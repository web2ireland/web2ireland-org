</div>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Foretal</a>, a new site based in Malta using IP developed in Ireland has just launched. It is built around users making predictions and voting on the predictions of others. The cunning twist is that you can do either part for free or for money.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1478075192/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1234/1478075192_5009d35a4d.jpg" class="block_center" alt="foretal01" height="192" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Betting sites like PaddyPower are very popular in Ireland but they currently donâ€™t provide a way for you to propose things to bet on. Foretal allows you to do it on anything. Many of the predictions on the site are currently either politics or sport but I expect the range to increase as people realise that the possibilities are unlimited.</p>
<p>The way it works is quite simple. Each time you vote on a prediction for free, you get a credit. Make five credits and you can post your own prediction for free. If you prefer, you can pay â‚¬5 to make a prediction and others can vote yes/no for money too. Once the closing date has passed, some of the money that has been bet is dispersed to those who voted correctly and to the predictor.</p>
<p>The site itself looks beautiful and the user interface is very easy to understand but painfully slow. I honestly love this site since I was looking to bet on the outcome of some reality TV show recently but couldnâ€™t find it on PaddyPower. Some of the things I can imagine people predicting and voting on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental disasters</li>
<li>Junta evictions</li>
<li>Deaths and marriages of famous people</li>
<li>Court case outcomes</li>
<li>Election outcomes in other countries</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1478075364/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1401/1478075364_bdc6bf9adb.jpg" class="block_center" alt="foretal02" height="240" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Win/Lose is very simply done on the basis of coverage by three web-sites. The first two are from a drop down list of news organisations like the BBC and you can decide the third one.</p>
<p>The mix of free/pay is a very smart move with the free side reminding me a little of <a href="http://www.jyte.com/">Jyte</a>. The requirement to vote before you can predict for free will drive up usage. The two things Iâ€™d like to see added are widgets so I can show what Iâ€™m predicting/voting on my blog/MySpace and RSS feeds for new predictions from each of the categories.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about the Malta angle. <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2007/10/02/mayo-news/">According to Julian Ellison</a> it is because Malta has the best on-line gaming regulatory framework. As with all of these sites, people in the USA cannot legally use it.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve made my first prediction. See if you can figure out which one it is.</p>

<p>Thanks Conor â€” sorry to hear that you founds things slow, weâ€™ll look into that, but nonetheless thanks for your very kind remarks. </p>
<p>Incidently, if you look at the public profile of your prediction, you can find two links. One which gives you an RSS feed, and the other as a normal link. They are:</p>
<p>For RSS:<br />

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>The very kind people at CMP and O&#8217;Reilly have offered some free tickets for Irish bloggers to attend <a href="http://berlin.web2expo.com/">Web2Expo in Berlin</a> from November 5th to 8th. Each of these tickets is worth â‚¬1100 so this is a big deal. We have OKed it with them to make the first two tickets available here as a pair.</p>
<p>Of course we&#8217;re not going to make it easy for you, so you have to do a little bit of work. Rather than just putting all the names in a hat and randomly picking one, we are going to have a little competition. </p>
<p>This is the deal; <strong>the Irish (or Ireland-based) blogger who makes the best suggestion for an original Web Application with an Irish focus will win the tickets</strong>. A few simple rules would make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;An Irish Facebook&#8221; is not a good enough suggestion</li>
<li>The suggestion should be a paragraph of text with &#8220;what&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221;</li>
<li>You MUST seriously intend going. Wasting these tickets would be criminal</li>
<li>You can give the second ticket away but offer it back if you can&#8217;t find a taker</li>
<li>&#8220;Best&#8221; is entirely at the discretion of the judges</li>
<li>It would be nice (but is not compulsory) to blog about this competition</li>
<li>It would be nice (but is not compulsory) to blog about Web2Expo if you win</li>
<li>The winning suggestion will be blogged here along with the winner&#8217;s name</li>
<li>&#8220;Blogger&#8221; includes company bloggers, not just personal blogs</li>
<li>The closing date for suggestions is Sunday October 7th</li>
<li>The winner will be announced by Tuesday October 9th</li>
<li>E-mail your suggestions (or questions) to <a href="mailto://web2ireland.editor@gmail.com/">Web2Ireland Editor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t win, we will be publishing a discount code shortly which will reduce the price of a standard ticket. </p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>A friend of mine in London met some people selling Viagra over the â€˜net last week. Last year they claim to have made Â£750,000 clear profit with a team of three people, and all through deft manipulation of their meta-data to get them up the Google rankings. And there we all are worrying about business models. When I hear stories like this, I do wonder whether I am making my business life more complicated than it needs to be, but in the spirit of openness, hereâ€™s what weâ€™re doing so you can judge for yourself:</p>
<p><strong>Whatever happened to <a href="http://www.tablane.com/">Tablane</a>?</strong> Some of you may remember the browser we released a couple of years ago and our aspiration to make Internet research more productive. It&#8217;s still the only browser with a five star user rating on <a href="http://www.download.com/Tablane-Browser-with-TClipper/3000-2356_4-10659847.html?tag=lst-0-1">Download.com</a>, but, weâ€™ve taken in just â‚¬100 in revenue from our TClipper tool and decided to go in a different direction. <strong>We are now collaborating with the <a href="http://www.deri.org/">Digital Enterprise Research Institute</a> of NUI Galway</strong> using some of their semantic smarts <strong>to build a new type of document search platform</strong>. Itâ€™s all very buggy and alpha at the moment, but itâ€™s interesting. Hats off to the <a href="http://www.bmwassembly.ie/">Border Midlands and West Assembly </a>for helping to fund this through their voucher scheme.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.intimemedia.com/">InTimeMedia</a>, our mobile technology business</strong>, has been doing steady work for the BBC and is looking for investment and new customers. We got <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/ResearchInnovate/R+and+D+Collaboration/Innovation+Partnerships.htm">Innovation Partnership</a> funding with Enterprise Ireland back in April which was handy. <strong>Weâ€™ve created an excellent framework for application development and can literally script new applications in minutes, plus our ability to synchronise apps with broadcast programmes has big wow factor.</strong> But the broadcasting industry in the UK has been in a flap over dodgy phone-ins, and corporate restructuring which slowed things. It looks like weâ€™re coming out of that now, and weâ€™ve started approaching the Irish market too, so fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, have you been to <a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Foretal.com</a>? </strong>This exciting venture has had its technology developed in Ireland, funded by angels, but licensed its IP to an operational company in Malta. Why? Because Malta has the best on-line gaming regulatory framework, and boy, is it rigorous. <strong>Foretal &#8212; a portal, foretelling the future &#8212; is a social site for people with an interest in the future. You can make predictions, and vote on the predictions of others. You can do this for free or for cash.</strong> We opened it up after two years of development last week. Your registrations and comments would be much appreciated. Itâ€™s very exciting, and potentially a customer for the platform weâ€™re developing with DERI. <a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, weâ€™ve just completed a left field project for <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/">Somerset House</a> in London in conjunction with two artists Langlands and Bell. Itâ€™s called <strong><a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/visual_arts/superactive_i2i_by_langlands__bell/default.asp">Superactivei2i</a> and involves a 3D model of the courtyard of Somerset House, links to flash movies, avatars, chat features and â€˜see what I seeâ€™ functionality whereby someone can control what someone else is seeing in their browser.</strong> We used Westport based <a href="http://www.amt3d.com/">AMT3D</a> to laser scan the courtyard and build the model, while Norwegian company <a href="http://www.myvr-software.com/">myVR</a> supplied the cutting edge 3D streaming technology. Best to use IE7.0 with pop-ups turned on for best effect (and doesnâ€™t work on the Mac yet). </p>
<p>Probably be easier to sell Viagra wouldn&#8217;t it!?</p>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.xiam.com/">Xiam Technologies</a> announced last week that Vodafone Ireland and Orange UK have signed up to use their MPOS (My Personal Offers System) technology to serve ads on their Mobile Internet portals.</p>
<p>It looks like this is the next logical progression in context sensitive advertising where mobile actually has a leg-up on web advertisers by knowing your history in addition to your current activity. They claim to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-to-one Targeting Technology</li>
<li>Advanced Profiling Techniques which targets advertising to specific market segments and individuals</li>
<li>Ad targeting using Demographic, Contextual, and Behavioural profiling</li>
<li>Real-Time Intelligent Recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mobile operator knows pretty much everything about your history and activity including your location. Of course it is pitched as a way of providing you with accurate â€œinformationâ€ but itâ€™ll be interesting to see if this technology is used on a subscriber opt-in basis or whether you suddenly find yourself shocked by spookily accurate mobile advertising.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a privacy sceptic; everything I do on the web or the phone is based on the assumption that I have none. In fact I like getting targeted accurate advertising instead the generic rubbish that Yahoo Mail generally tries to push on me. Iâ€™ll happily swap my attention data for good discounts on products and services I like. But Iâ€™m not sure that is a mainstream position. How do you feel about ads based on knowing lots about you?</p>

<p>Looks great in principle, and should work a treat. However, the relevance and context will all be around what the advertiser is looking for rather than what the customer is looking for. So it just means that those loan, insurance and credit card ads are better targeted rather than directing stuff to me that I am actually interested in. And that boils down to where the money is unfortunately.</p>
<p>There are also plenty folks around who are paranoid about their personal privacy. And on top of that, when you are paying good money to a company for a service, you donâ€™t expect to be tracked (without express permission) so that they can make even *more* money from you. A balance needs to be found and Iâ€™m very interested to see if they manage to find the balance or whether the dollar signs will win.</p>
<p>Keep us posted!</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>This may be old news but Iâ€™ve just discovered that there are now <a href="http://www.rte.ie/">RTE</a> Twitter accounts. I actually found out about it whilst testing the new tracker functionality.</p>
<p>There is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtenews">RTE News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtesport">RTEÂ  Sport</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtebusiness">RTE Business</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtearts">RTE Arts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst there are a reasonable number of RSS feeds on RTE, Iâ€™m a fan of adding some news sites to Twitter and Jaiku so I get instant IMs for stuff as it happens. It is not clear if these accounts were created by RTE or someone else since they are just using <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a> for it. Given that they are using RTE logos, I hope it is an â€œofficialâ€ effort.</p>
<p>It did however highlight a flaw in the new Twitter feature. I set the alert for â€œ#corkâ€ but it sent me an RTE news story with the word â€œcorkâ€. This is a really bad idea and I hope itâ€™s an early bug.</p>

<p>There is LOADS of services like it on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/News+Services" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.pbwiki.com/News+Services</a></p>
<p>The BBC is very open about their content. <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Plus itâ€™s not as if Iâ€™m claiming it as my own or trying to pass it off as someone elses. I could easily use the user name for evil and complain about RTÃ‰ News!?</p>

<p>Then Iâ€™d be very wary about using their logos. Good intentions donâ€™t count if they get litigious on you.</p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>After a big build-up of media attention peaking with an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/technology/circuits/27pogue.html">New York Times</a>, Cubic Telecomâ€™s <a href="http://www.maxroam.com/">MAXroam</a> went live <a href="http://blog.roam4free.ie/maxroam-goes-live/">this morning</a>. Using the great line of â€œTravel Global, Pay Localâ€, these guys are going for the jugular of the incumbent mobile operators and their roaming charges.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1446741779/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1356/1446741779_7136a6f2be.jpg" class="block_center" width="500" height="53" alt="maxroam01.png" /></a></p>
<p>The core package is a MAXroam sim, â‚¬5 free calling credit and 1 free incoming number from USA, UK, France or Ireland for â‚¬29.99. Of course you can only use an unlocked phone with this SIM. I was able to get my phone unlocked by simply ringing Vodafone. If you have a Nokia N-Series this may take a few days as the request is actually forwarded to Nokia. Many mainstream phones can be done by the Cubic guys themselves. In fact, I unlocked an old 6230i for Roam4Free using one of many free sites on the web.</p>
<p>A sample of the costs is as follows. If you register an Irish number with them and then travel to France, receiving a call costs 21c and making one costs 33c. Irish people ringing you pay local charges. Add a French number and the costs to you are still the same but now your French contacts call using that number and pay only local rates. You can have numbers from up to 50 different countries on the one SIM or even 50 different numbers within one country (particularly useful for the USA).</p>
<p>I was one of the early users of Roam4Free V1. In that case you had a fixed Estonian number which gave you and your callers great discounts but it caused a big mind-set issue for callers and I gave up on it. The Cubic guys have promised a replacement SIM for all those V1 users. MAXroam is a major step forward and is a complete no-brainer for anyone who travels even semi-regularly. Iâ€™m eagerly awaiting mine in the post.</p>

<p>who is the person with enough time on his hands to check blogs every few minutes?</p>

<p>It appears you sent the first, and asked for a reply </p>
<p>So donâ€™t try and smear me as obsessive.</p>

<p>Andy<br />
you have way too much time on your hand mate. 3 emails to me today, might be time to close this particular chapter<br />
Conversation is closed, sorry</p>

<p>and, for example, although there is discussion on his blog of a number of global SIMs, including one that is the same as Maxroam, when I posted a German one in response to a comment by a German, it was removed within a few minutes</p>
<p>by the way, my email was not abusive &#8211; I even pointed out to him that I had defended Maxroam on another forum against a load of made-up nonsense posted by a reseller of another product</p>

<p>Just why is it that Mr Phelan emails me, soliciting a reply, then ignores it?</p>
<p>Heâ€™s done this a couple of times now.</p>
<p>And then told the rest of the world that this was abuse  by me.</p>

<p>Coughs loudly buts sincerely thanks Andy for that update<br />
Any further work we schedule, we might notify Andy first to cut out the middleman.<br />
Its wonderful to have such a fan of MAXroam keeping an eye on things for us, we may be even able to take a few hours off this week if Andy is available Saturday evening as the Police are playing Dublin.We have the tickets ,would be a shame to waste them ,how about it Andy?</p>

<p>â€¦ looks like most of the tariffs went up by a third</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by andy</b><br />at 10/1/2007 9:30:38 AM
<p>Conor, thereâ€™s no need to make it ridiculous, hinting that only a minority of users will not benefit, when anyone roaming in Europe can get similar or better tariffs from the main networks.</p>
<p>As for Mr Phelanâ€™s remarks, why not devote time to getting your published tariffs correct, rather than spending your time on the internet resorting to personal insults on other peopleâ€™s behaviour?</p>
</p>

<p>ahhahh the lovely Andy pops up again<br />
it might worth me offering him a job but it appears he is already busy being an armchair general.<br />
Well thatâ€™s four days of it now Andy on a full time basis and every bit of it raising the MAXroam profile<br />
Keep up the good work buddy.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>One of the biggest drawbacks of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> compared to <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> for micro-blogging is the inability to do decent filtering. In Jaiku you can create channels around topics of interest e.g. <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/podcamp">#podcamp</a>, <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/irishopencoffee">#irishopencoffee</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1446225445/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1415/1446225445_ecdd4832ee.jpg" class="block_center" alt="jaiku_channel_01.png" height="280" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Recently Chris Messina started doing <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/">his own version</a> of channels or tags on Twitter by simply marking words in his Tweets with a # symbol. I think the idea was to create a groundswell of support so that it would get baked into the product just like the @ convention. <a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/message/2007/08/chris-messina-o.html">Stowe Boyd</a> became an (almost unreadable) early adopter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1447082688/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1003/1447082688_b55783328d.jpg" class="block_center" alt="twitter_tags_01.png" height="183" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Today Twitter effectively <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/09/tracking-twitter.html">launched support for this</a> without mentioning it and for IM and Mobile only. In fact what they launched was the ability to track any tweets anywhere which mention a particular string e.g. NYC. As an example I canâ€™t think of anything worse, as you could be overwhelmed with incomings. However, if you do it for these pseudo-channels like #Cork or #BarCampGalway or heck #IrishDogRacing then you have something very powerful and useful.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1447114868/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1157/1447114868_915226e5a0.jpg" class="block_center" alt="twitter_tags_04.png" height="290" width="460" /></a></p>
<p>The â€œspamâ€ issue will have to be addressed when it becomes a problem. I hope they extend this to the web-site too as it could genuinely be a big step forward in functionality. Of course, being a Twitter feature, I havenâ€™t actually got the notifications to work yet!</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Twitter has a UK number but not an Irish one. Therefore some UK mobile users can send for nothing if they have free texts. In Ireland we pay cost of international text. On my Voda account that is 21c but I believe on Meteor it is approx 16c. </p>
<p>Jaiku only has a Finnish number and that is 21c from Ireland for me too.</p>

<p>I know this might sound ridiculous, but I really havenâ€™t seen the potential of twitter until recently.  The marketing potential is huge.</p>
<p>One question:  how much do mobile operators charge you to send texts through twitter?  Is it the price of standard Irish texts or do the mobile operators charge you for texting a UK number?  I know it might sound like a ridiculous question, but any info would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a great blog incidentally.</p>

<p>I was only joking about the pup by the way, I donâ€™t own one myself. Iâ€™ve also subscribed to a few tags and only one (maxroam) has yet brought any results. I find it hard to believe the other (common words) havenâ€™t been tweeted yet. Hmmmâ€¦.</p>

<p>I was going for niche with that one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as with so many things associated with Twitter, this is just not working for me. I added tracking for about six different terms on one account and sent Tweets with another account containing those terms. None of them were detected. </p>
<p>Yet when I set a tracker on the term #Podcamp, it found someone who tweeted with the word Podcamp (sans #). It looks like instead of supporting the # convention they are actively not supporting it. Very disappointing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve become quite a fan of Jaiku over Twitter recently. Iâ€™ve been using Jaiku a lot more recently popping comments in here and there (hadnâ€™t used comments until recently) mainly to get some contact going with people I figured Iâ€™ll encounter if I make it along to a BarCamp or Open Coffee event. Channels are neat, I enjoyed the way #barcampireland was used.</p></p>

<p>Cubic Telecomâ€™s Maxroam went live today and I really like the prices for this international SIM card. Making a call to wherever in the world costs ?0.35 if you are in Germany. There is no difference between countries. The entire world costs the ?0.3â€¦</p></p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>The buzz around <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> continues to increase and Iâ€™m noticing more mentions in Irish tech blogs all the time. One of the highlights for many people at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampGalway">BarCamp Galway</a> was Walter Higgins kicking off 19 EC2 instances running <a href="http://www.pixenate.com/">Pixenate</a>. This incredible scalability available for mere pennies is a killer argument for many unfunded start-ups around the world.</p>
<p>Last September I saw Jeff Barr at <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">d.Construct</a> and his presentation on AWS was a real eye-opener, I simply wasnâ€™t aware of anything outside EC2 and S3. His co-evangelist Mike Culver <a href="http://evangelists.wetpaint.com/page/MikeCulverEuropeFall2007">is coming to Dublin</a> and will hold an event on October 30th to preach the message and bring everyone up to date with all their most recent developments.</p>
<p>Mike intends to do a three part presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Their view of where things are going</li>
<li>The services themselves</li>
<li>A live demo</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that they should have several actual users of AWS in the audience, Iâ€™d love the demo to be about some of the more cutting edge things they are doing or even to include audience participation from the likes of Pixenate or PutPlace. Hopefully they will also have some news on built-in support for MySQL persistent storage and whether Amazon.co.uk will eventually have all the same services available as Amazon.com.</p>
<p>I would love to see Amazon extend their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=332775011">Startup Project</a> events outside of the USA too. These are networking events where start-ups can learn about Amazon Web Services, how to attract VCs, and how successful start-ups have built their business using AWSâ€™ solutions. They strike me as the perfect business complement to the more technical events.</p>
<p>If you intend coming to the event, please RSVP over at the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/262102/">Upcoming.org page</a> so they can get some feel for numbers. The current room holds about 30-40 people. Anyone looking at application scalability needs to be there! Finally, <a href="http://evangelists.wetpaint.com/page/MikeCulverEuropeFall2007">check here</a> for the other events that Mike is taking part in whilst he is here.</p>
