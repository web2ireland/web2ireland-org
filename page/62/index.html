<div class="entry"><p>The Irish Twittosphere grows daily and has been attracting users far outside the initial cabal of geeks. The performance and scaling issues of earlier in the summer have been forgiven and generally the site has been stable. However in the past week much more serious problems have started happening.</p>
<p>We are getting multiple reports of users seeing gaps of of between 4 and 12 hours in the updates from those they are following. Unlike the usual out-of-order messing that people seem to accept, these are black holes which are never re-filled. At the moment I've had no network updates for 4 hours and I'm in contact with two users who have had none for three days! The RSS feeds are similarly broken.</p>
<p>So far, Twitter has seemed resilient to user defection, I have to wonder how long that will continue. I would be quite happy to move completely to Jaiku if (and it's a big if) my network did too. Keep a close eye on all of those articles about social network portability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you too are frustrated with the silence on Twitter, you can find <a href="http://conoro.jaiku.com/">me</a> over on Jaiku where you'll also find <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/podcamp">several</a> <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/paddysvalley">Irish</a> <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/irishopencoffee">specific</a> channels.</p>

<p><b>Comment posted by James Corbett</b><br />at 9/1/2007 11:48:09 AM
<p>That really is the big if Conor and the reason I can't see why any social network should be in a rush to open up the social graph unless forced into a corner by the competition.</p>
<p>I've run a niche sports website for 9 years which is mainly based around a discussion forum. You might call it a Social Network 0.5. What we've learned in that time is that, as long as you don't completely drop the ball, a social network is amazingly resilient to mass migration. We know because we've had several threats of mutiny after, regrettably, being forced to ban a few members along the way. Though a few of those threats gather a reasonably large amount of support none succeeded because none of our competing communities had anything like the number of members or volume of user generated content. To revive a cliche from Web 1.0 we really did have first mover advantage.</p>
<p>I too would be more than happy to leave Twitter for good in favour of Jaiku. But unless 50+% of my contacts do at the same time I'm unlikely to do so.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>The annual <a href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/">InterTradeIreland</a> all-island <a href="http://seedcorn.intertradeireland.com/index2.php">Seedcorn Competition</a> is heading towards its closing date of September 28th and the question many are asking is should we enter?. €100k for the winner is nothing to be sniffed at but does your web app stand a chance?</p>
<p>The competition started in 2003 and the winners to date have been Luxcel Biosciences, SmartHomes, Sigmoid Biosciences and EnBio. There is a very clear pattern here which seems to be putting off many in the web space from entering. Looking at the regional winners from the various years, there is a much wider spread of companies with several web ventures. However it does look like the scoring box marked defensible IP is highlighted in red given the types of businesses I checked.</p>
<p>Entering a competition like this is not a trivial decision since you are committing yourself to a lot of time and effort to go up against many more mature companies for a shot at €20k as a regional winner and then possibly the big prize. There is also €50k for the best emerging company.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that going through the process can be a great way of sanity-checking your business. If you don't have a good business plan, if your deck stinks, if you can't convince a panel of the value of your business, then Seedcorn will highlight this to you very quickly. Better to discover these problems in a competition than when you are trying and convince an Angel or VC to invest in your business.</p>
<p>I hope InterTrade avoids giving the 2007 prize to yet another Bio company. They also need to get more people on their evaluation panels who have a deep understanding of the web and content businesses. My experience in one of their master-classes was that this expertise was simply not in the panel I presented to.</p>
<p>Are you entering Seedcorn 2007? Have you considered it and decided against it? Have you entered in previous years? We'd love to hear about your experiences and why you made the decisions you did.</p>

<p>I entered it last year and came away with a Highly Commended Award. Not sure if they give those to all entries <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
It took about a week to get my plan ready to enter and over all i found it worth while. They allow you to follow up after the competition to get feedback on your plan and where you can improve it.</p></p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Whilst Bebo is far and away the most popular social networking site in Ireland, it has always been a pretty mediocre site based on features compared to the competition. There is a PhD waiting for someone who figures out how it got the initial traction here. Of course, once it hit critical mass it became mandatory for kids of a certain age.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/joej/statuses/234481562">Joe Johnson just tweeted</a> that he saw an RSS icon in the blog feature and I had to check it out. And indeed they do. Of course there is still not even basic text formatting or HTML in the blog but it looked like a start.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1266407466/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1266407466_8c43acf1aa_o.png" class="block_center" alt="Bebo Blog Page" height="202" width="593" /></a></p>
<p>I clicked around a bit more and discovered that it is nowhere else (like photos etc) which was disappointing.<br />
Then I went back to the feed and clicked on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1266407202/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1234/1266407202_0e8ef14f36_o.png" class="block_center" alt="Bebo RSS Feed URL" height="82" width="539" /></a></p>
<p>Look at the URL. Notice the word api? Are we seeing baby step one in a Bebo API? Are they going to beat MySpace to the punch? Are they looking at the success of the Facebook platform and realising this could be the thing to get them beyond bit-player status globally? I'll be watching them a lot more closely from now on.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>We are genuinely thrilled that Enterprise Ireland has agreed to run a pitch training session in advance of DemoBar on Thursday September 13th. It is aimed at those doing a DemoBar presentation that evening and also as the first training session for those attending the Paddy&#8217;s Valley trip who intend pitching in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The format has not been finalised yet, it depends to some degree on the numbers who sign up. However it will involve pitching to an expert panel and/or the other attendees in addition to guidance and training.</p>
<p>If you have applied for DemoBar, you really shouldn&#8217;t miss this. I have taken part in similar sessions and they are absolute gold. It could be the difference between getting your idea on the map or disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Sign up now for Pitch Training by emailing your details to web2ireland DOT editor AT gmail DOT com</p>
<p>We will confirm date and time asap.</p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>The Nubiq guys in Waterford have been building applications for the mobile lifestyle for quite a while now. The <a href="http://www.mobiseer.com/">mobiseer</a> site (<a href="http://mobiseer.mobi/">mobiseer.mobi</a> from your phone) has just gone into public beta and is all about managing bookmarks of your favourite web-sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1258577238/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1440/1258577238_153dd490ec.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer Front Page" height="242" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The site enables you to organise, tag, share and manage your favourite .mobi websites either via the site itself or your phone. I use the comparison to Ma.gnolia rather than the more obvious del.icio.us simply because the feature set is more closely aligned, particularly with groups and ratings. The .mobi version of the site is very fast to load on my N70 which is a critical requirement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1258632496/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/1258632496_d87f1966c3_m.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer on N70" height="240" width="226" /></a></p>
<p>The core of the service is tagged bookmarking which alone is highly useful when optimised for a mobile device. The bookmarking features of Opera and Opera Mini on an N70 leave a lot to be desired. Whilst there are a few ways of accessing del.icio.us on a mobile device, they seem hacky. Ma.gnolia seems to have nothing for mobile and their design-heavy (and slow) site is probably not a good match for your phone.</p>
<p>As with any site like this, the first focus should be on the individual's needs and then on community. You can just use it as a personal store and ignore everything else. However the tag browsing, groups and ratings add useful social aspects to the site. In fact, given the slow uptake of the .mobi domain, this may be the best way of getting good mobile sites visible to a wider audience. The availability of RSS for most areas of the site is always key &#8211; I subscribe to tags of interest so that new bookmarks from users with similar tastes will bring me back to the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1257721699/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1382/1257721699_0f55b0a0cd.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer Bookmark page" height="260" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the sites you bookmark do not have to be .mobi ones, but it would make sense that they are usable on a mobile (e.g. m.twitter.com). On that point, when I tried to load the .mobi on an N770, they obviously detected that I was not on a mobile and gave me the full site. However I was unable to logon. I actually use the m versions of many sites on the N770 for speed reasons. If I request the mobi version of a site, I wish it would give me what I asked for.</p>
<p>I particularly like the My Mobile feature which allows you to drag n drop your favourite bookmarks into the order you'd like to see them displayed by default when your phone connects to the site.  Something which might be nice for the future would be bookmark import from IE, FF, del.icio.us and ma.gnolia. They could even go one better and recommend mobile variations of bookmarks as they are imported.</p>
<p>Whilst the site is in beta, I've noticed no major problems. Most issues are just normal fine-tuning ones like this user has not added any bookmarks when this user = you. They should also add some filtering on the landing-page featured bookmarks to remove the naughty ones!</p>
<p>This is a genuinely useful site both for desktop and mobile use and I would strongly consider setting it as my browser home on both N70 and N770.</p>

<p>Hi Conor,<br />
 Thanks for the feedback and review. It is nice to finally be out there in BETA release. So keep the feedback coming <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>At present we do device detection upon access to either our .mobi or .com domains. While this is not always perfect, it does work most of the time. As we currently support a multiple of device formats (HTML, XHTML-MP, WML etc.) we attempt to detect the device and render as appropriate. As mobile devices are getting better and better all the time we default to HTML if we cannot detect the device.</p>
<p>You can add the following flag to the URL to bypass the detection routines and simply force XHTML for your N770. See the following link, this flag will work on both the .mobi and .com domains.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.mobiseer.mobi/?output=xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobiseer.mobi/?output=xhtml</a></p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<div class="entry"><p>I'm interested in getting some feedback on small business usage of <a href="http://www.google.com/a">GAFYD</a> (as I like to call Google Apps for Your Domain) in Ireland (and Europe generally). Until this year I was very dubious of Steve Gillmor's Office is dead mantra but as the year has progressed I have found myself using more and more online applications and fewer installed ones.</p>
<p>The standard Google Applications from GMail to Calendar and Docs/Spreadsheets are solid useful usable tools. It got to the point a few months back where I was happy to try out the free Google Apps for your domain. This entails some DNS changes on your side so that Google becomes the provider for your company email. You then get your own custom versions of GMail, GTalk, Calendar, Docs/Spreadsheets and a Personalised home page.</p>
<p>Initial impressions were good, particularly given that it is free but very quickly I found myself running into a variety of limitations and problems. It is quite clear that the For Your Domain development is done is total isolation from all the other online Google apps.</p>
<p>The single biggest limitation is that the login you are given for the Domain Applications does not work on any other Google application outside of the ones I have listed. In particular there is no Notebook, Google Groups or Google Reader. For a company so intent on being an integral part of every aspect of your online life, this just seems bizarre. There are a bunch of other problems like</p>
<ul>
<li>The Personalised Home page is very rough compared to iGoogle</li>
<li>The Calendar Widget on that page is totally broken</li>
<li>Many third party widgets do not work with that page</li>
<li>GTalk for your domain is completely flaky with third party applications like Pidgin</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall experience really is is less than slick. If I had a full SSO Google Apps experience, I would happily pay quite a lot per year for them taking all that administration effort off my hands.</p>
<p>What have your experiences been of Google Apps, GAFYD and the competition?</p>
<ul>
<li>Using and happy</li>
<li>Using but not happy</li>
<li>Used but reverted</li>
<li>Considering</li>
<li>Never heard of it</li>
</ul>
<p>I hear only good things about <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> and our limited usage of it so far has been positive. Any other recommendations?</p>

<p>Gmail, which Google Apps uses with a custom frontend, does not follow best practices. The source IP is not put into the email headers. This means that companies filtering mail end up filtering the Google SMTP completely or blocking certain netblocks when there is abuse. It's been a topic of discussion on a lot of the anti-spam mailing lists over the last couple of years. </p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Michele &#8211; it did occur to me that the potential was there, but have there been actual instances of Google mishandling email?</p>

<p>We're seeing quite a few people trying it out. Whether they will stay with it permanently or not remains to be seen.<br />
I can see the attraction of the apps, but I would be very concerned about Google's (mis)handling of email.</p>

<p>I set this up last year for over 1,000 people and was happy with it.  When dealing with so many users, there were some problems with the bulk import (unable to assign aliases as part of the bulk import, for example), and really poor support from Google. </p>
<p>I was happy enough with the experience that I decided to use Google Apps for Your Domain for my company's email this year.  I upgraded to Premier just because I had experienced the lack of support in the standard edition.  I agree that it is annoying that the login doesn't carry through to other Google services, and it is also annoying that very few of the external applications which have 'Gmail support' have 'Google Mail for your domain' support, even though it is probably only a couple of lines of extra code.  I use iCal for calendar, and BaseCamp, but I keep coming back to Google Apps for collaboration on spreadsheets and word processor (BaseCamp's Writeboards are very poor).</p>
<p>I had a quick look at Zoho and it seemed decent &#8211; will have to test it out some more though.</p>

<p>Using it and happy. Not crazy about the seperate SSO for the rest of Google, but its worth living with for the convenience of a maintainance free mail and calendar service.</p>
<p>We also use gtalk quite a bit and we have a start page with a bunch of useless widgets on it that I  blow hot and cold on.</p>

<p>We use it for similar reasons Conn. It also helps a lot when travelling. </p>
<p>I love the idea of GAFYD, it just feels like they need a Google SVP or EVP somewhere to crack a few heads together and get _all_ the apps working under Single Sign On.</p>
<p>I also like the Zoho freemium model and have heard they are getting lots of traction despite not being Google.</p>

<p>You and I have twittered before Conor, about the risks of my total reliance on Gmail. I feel happier about it now that I've backed it up locally with POP.  I'm not using GAFYD yet, but I'm increasingly building my operation around Google apps.  I passed my first scalability hurdle last week, setting up a second workstation in my office for occasional contributors.  It's a PC running Ubuntu and it doesn't need Office &#8211; neither MS nor Open.  It doesn't need backing up either, or user configuration.  As my operation grows I can clone as many of them as I want.</p>
<p>It's all about scalability.  At this critical stage in my business I don't have money for servers, backup systems or expensive software.  I certainly have no time to manage and maintain these systems.  Right now Google does that for me.  The challenge for them is to build a system which can grow with me, so that when I can afford to invest in my own infrastructure, I may not feel the need to.  If they can do that, then Office really is dead &#8211; and so too perhaps is Exchange, SQL Server, Oracle </p>

<p>I implemented Google Aps last February &#8211; At first, I thought I was going to use it a lot: Spreadsheets, docs, calendars But I experienced the same hiccups you mentioned. I ended up using it as a mail service only (easy to add users and same benefits as gmail) and use Basecamp to manage the rest of our activity.</p>

<p>Excellent sticking the finger in where it hurts. Lot's of good question. Google is doing lots of clever stuff. But in the apps and office space they have made a start but it has quite a way to go still. Same with gdrive, where is it? Is Google stalling? Lacking a vision on a way forward? I wonder about that an awful lot lately</p></p>
