<div class="author">
<img alt='' src='//0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=32' class='avatar avatar-32 photo avatar-default' height='32' width='32' /><small>22nd of <a href="/2007/09/">September 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>I was lucky enough to attend TC40 as a guest of Cubic Telecom last week and came away buzzing with energy and ideas. Whilst the echo-chamber of Silicon Valley was at maximum volume, there were still many useful things that Irish web start-ups could take from the two days.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I came away suffering badly from greener-grass syndrome. Seeing Geni having a $100m valuation or a single-city dating site with 6m uniques per month gives you a sense of the scale difference between there and here. I talked to one Dutch entrepreneur who felt he had to go to the USA to build his site and has never looked back. I talked to several who are thinking about it and discovered that an old friend of mine has made the move too.</p>
<p>Enterprise Ireland told me that this is the first year since the crash that the numbers of Irish moving their bases to SV has become noticeable. However the consensus was that a move to the US should never be done just to get access to capital. It must be your target market and whatever USP you have in Ireland must remain one in the USA or you will find it impossible to rise above the noise. Access to developers is a major problem once again in SV so keeping the engineering function in Ireland (or moving it to Eastern Europe or India) is the way to go.</p>
<p>Jeff Clavier <a href="http://blog.softtechvc.com/2007/09/announcing-soft.html">announced a new fund</a> at the event and it struck me as the ideal structure for an Irish one. A mix of Jeff himself, institutional investors and other angels have come together to create a small seed fund of $12m with investments ranging from $100k to $500k. I'd much prefer that EI took this approach with their leverage money and pulled together a team like that. Imagine a fund with Brian Caulfield, Chris Horn, Peter Conlon and Jerry Kennelly on board!</p>
<p>In fact the Getting Funded panel was worth the trip on its own. I hope they make a video of it available on the web as it should be compulsory viewing for anyone doing a start-up. In particular, Sumant Mandal from <a href="http://www.clearstone.com/">Clearstone</a> was completely honest about investing being an emotional activity not a logical one. If you believe in the people and/or the product, then the numbers come afterwards.</p>
<p>A Finnish entrepreneur asked the one question on the tip of my tongue &#8211; would you guys invest in a business based outside of the US? The initial answers were sure, if the business was compelling enough but as they talked it through, it became clear that the chances of them doing so were minimal.</p>
<p>This was reinforced by some opinions expressed by Marc Andressen. Here is an incredibly successful entrepreneur and investor whose most recent success was the $1.6B sale of Opsware, a company that many people thought was toast five years ago. His questions about distribution to most of the start-ups were very incisive and highlighted major flaws in their plans. However he showed his own blind-side when he admitted that he couldn't see the point of Cubic Telecom's <a href="http://www.maxroam.com/">MaxRoam</a> since he rarely left California (and possibly isn't that concerned about mobile phone bills!). As European start-ups we need to realise that people in the Valley rarely look outside of the Valley.</p>
<p>New York, on the other hand, is a different place entirely. I had a short but revealing conversation with a semi-competitor of LouderVoice based there. They were fully up to speed with the European scene and were able to offer informed opinions on companies over this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="http://www.tripit.com/">TripIt</a> and <a href="http://www.yapme.com/">Yap</a> made it on to the stage this year, I look forward to seeing at least <a href="http://www.touristr.com/">Touristr</a> and <a href="http://www.mysay.com/">MySay</a> on the stage next year.</p>
<p>The main lesson learned was that an Irish start-up with a great product can go to Silicon Valley, wow the crowd, get enormous press coverage and show more marketing savvy than any other company presenting. Watch those Cubic guys, I wasn't the only person there who believed they were watching the launch of a $1B business.</p>

<p>Well, those trucks are usually reserved for natural disasters, national emergencies, etcI doubt music concerts nor nerd fests fall under those jurisdictions. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>They do tend to show up at 3GSM or CTIA, when it's obvious that you'll otherwise have a meltdown given the density of devicesall trying to show you why you'd want to watch television on a screen the size of a postage stamp, that in turn drains your battery within 30 minutessigh. Goodness, I think we could derive a better killer app for 3G than that. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p>That's really useful to know. </p>
<p>I've been hearing about the complete collapse of mobile comms at outdoor concerts here because of tower overloading. Our cunning plan to get mobile reviews of the music acts fell apart as a result.</p>
<p>I'm a bit shocked that they can't get Vodafone or O2 to sponsor these concerts and drive up with a few trucks!</p>
<p>Don't get me started on well-meaning EU politicians.</p>
</p>

<p>Conor,</p>
<p>(1) The low cost repeaters would have died since they support 2-3 devices max. Our chairman was at TC40 as well, is responsible for building most of the US wireless towers, and had interesting comments he muttered under his breath. I'll be sure to relay them if we ever meet up for friendly drinks. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> That said, it would have been difficult for the organizers to solve this disconnect without changing the venue (which was superb otherwise); what you really needed there one of those base stations in a truck to support the density of devices in that room. In retrospect, they did a terrific job MCing the event around whatever (few) glitches presented themselves in their first ever conference.</p>
<p>(2) I'm sure the EU politicians mean well in being so protective of your biometric data, so I sent a request to our general counsel on how we could add folks on the other side of the pond to our closed betas. Will post if I hear anything positive.</p>
<p>Thx for your continued feedback!<br />
i.</p>

<p>Joe, I'm with Jeff on this and I think he has the track record of success to back it up.</p>
<p>Igor, I pointed out on Facebook that you can get a mobile repeater/booster for less $200 on eBay! The lack of infrastructure support for that panel was the low point of the event.</p>
<p>Forget the EU, I'll sign a waiver just to give Yap a go. Hopefully ourselves and the Brits won't be too hard to understand!</p>

<p>WellI'll take that as good natured ribbing if you eventually noticed that we weren't just a bunch of college kids mashing off the shelf parts. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> We prefer folks that have done *real* engineering on our team, so you can talk DSPs with them any time of the week. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Re: twice the fun in presenting, wouldn't need that if we had bloody wireless coverage or their audio cables didn't give way. Although Jason and Michael did a fantastic job MC'ing and being flexible because of these external factors non inherent to our demo, we do owe them *many* thanks for a quick recovery.</p>
<p>Yep, realize that context shift between the app and the browser's annoying. Some surprises are in store that will negate thatit should also work with your bluetooth headsets. We'll definitely let you guys play with it as soon as we canwe'll need to spin up an unsigned version, EU language model, and be sensitive to your privacy policies though. Not sure they'll take kindly to our capturing audio files over there for processing here.</p>

<p>Conor 12m is too small. With 12m you don't have the ability to follow the money on your successes and you are spread too thin to sustain a lot of failures. I would want to see a fund of at least 100m to be comfortable that it was sustainable as a VC fund.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by Conor O&#8217;Neill</b><br />at 9/25/2007 3:23:51 AM
<p>Hey Igor &#8211; I don't doubt the complexity at all, I worked in DSP in a previous life. The more the demo progressed the more it impressed me. Even if you guys did get two chances <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Only one flaw in the demo. Don't tell people that you can use Yap to TXT whilst driving if one of the examples you give is opening up a web-browser during a session. Cops are not going to like that one.</p>
<p>Yours was one of the few apps that I went to install after TC40. Any chance of a beta invite? Does it work outside of US on a Nokia N70?</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by Igor Jablokov</b><br />at 9/24/2007 6:05:00 PM
<p>Conor,</p>
<p>Don't underestimate how difficult the Yap platform was to invent, as it does not simply move audio files about. Our folks previously worked on iPod and ViaVoice prior to this as it required non-trivial skills to bring to market, with quite a number of patents that fell out of the experience. So we'll look forward to some unique Irish startups next year. <img src='//ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>That said, MAXroam was certainly impressive &#038; I'm looking forward to using it as we drive our solution into international markets.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
i.</p>

<p>Markus, I know the guys had to push very hard to launch in time for TC40. They are only just back home. I'm sure all the information you need will be up on the site soon.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>Vincent Glennon is responsible for the very useful <a href="http://useamap.com/">UseAMap</a> site. He seems to specialise in building very smart single-function sites that the big guys will never do. His latest mapping application, which he launched at DemoBar, is <a href="http://justroutes.com/">JustRoutes</a>. It provides information on public transport routes in Dublin via two simple clicks on a Google Map: Starting point and Destination point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1387145276/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1415/1387145276_c620fdd7c9.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Just Routes Main Screen" height="322" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I could have done with this many times in the past couple of months and I'm sure that applies to anyone who travels to the capital on a semi-regular basis. Heck I know plenty of people who live in Dublin and who only know the bus routes from their house to work.</p>
<p>When he was trialling it, I suggested that he ensure it works well on mobiles as I could imagine that being a popular use case. Unfortunately I didn't have much luck with either Opera and Opera Mini 4 on my Nokia N70. The maps aren't really readable and the text entry interface didn't like my locations.</p>
<p>Vincent has also implemented the UseAMap idea here where any route you request is given the equivalent of a TinyURL. Another nice touch is the cost estimate for the journey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1387145414/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1088/1387145414_f44f47a10e.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Just Routes Output" height="433" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Hopefully when Google Maps stops being a bad joke outside of the large cities here, he will add national bus and rail routes. If he included private operators too, that might be a route to a revenue stream. I'm not sure what his monetization plans are but the whole area of local advertising could be a possibility. Alternatively, CIE (the bus/rail operator) could show uncharacteristic commercial sense and buy it from him or invest in it.</p>

<p>Vinny has UseAMap working with Yahoo and MS. Problem with Yahoo is their idiotic non-commercial-only use of all their APIs. They have to change this asap if they are to compete for mindshare.</p>

<p>I got a demo of this at Demobar on Thursday and I think it's a great idea! I also thought a mobile App version of this would be very useful This is the type of information that people need when they're out and about!</p>
<p>The best of luck to the lads!</p>

<p>Given that Yahoo Maps seem to be more up to date with Irish maps than Google, could this be trialed on Yahoo, or are the APIs still lacking.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>Last night they blew the bl***y roof off Ely HQ in Dublin's South Docks! Hands down the best gathering of people working here in this business ever. Ryan Carson figures 200 people turned up. I wouldn't be surprised, we were squeezed in like sardines and loved every minute of it. As someone said It's like we've crammed our own Silicon Valley into one room</p>
<p>The the four events of the day; Pitch Training, Paddy's Valley Meetup, DemoBar and FOWA RoadTrip overlapped and merged in and out of each other from 2pm onwards. The feedback on the Enterprise Ireland training was all positive and a big thumbs up to Paul Fisher from Advent for sitting in on some of the sessions.</p>
<p>I don't think I have ever seen that wonderful mix of people collected together here before. We had developers, geeks, entrepreneurs, VCs, telcos, Microsoft, PR people, Ryan and a bunch of startups all talking at 100 mph. The enthusiasm and eagerness and adrenalin in the room was infectious. I was particularly glad to see some of the startups make links to certain serious players for the first time. If they raise a round, I hope they can say it all happened that night in Ely HQ.</p>
<p>The event could not have happened without Fergus Burns from <a href="http://www.nooked.com/">Nooked</a>, a man who has worked tirelessly for the web community in Ireland and who deserves tons of kudos for that. Apart from the event itself, Fergus also put together a great bunch of sponsors. I shouldn't call out one but I will. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/clare_dillon/">Clare Dillon</a> in Microsoft Ireland has  arranged sponsorship for many of the community events here. Clare gets it and we all appreciate what she and her team do.</p>
<p>Ryan was fantastic with making sure to talk to all the start-ups and do interviews. Conn and the Intruders guys took plenty of footage too. I somehow managed to not take one single picture for which I should be flogged. One startup managed to show the power of their soon-to-be-released product when a punter knocked a pint of beer all over their demo laptop. Joe Drumgoole calmly turned the laptop over and said It's ok, it's all backed-up with <a href="http://www.putplace.com/">PutPlace.com</a></p>
<p>For the next one, we're gonna need a bigger building.</p>

<p>Hear hear, Conor.  It was an immense night and that vibe was simply electricity &#8211; every you turned, the enthusiasm and energy just crackling from head to head.  Definitely a shame that I had to leave early, but am now so energised to startup soon and really go for it.  Very, very exciting times.</p>

<p>[] Those of you who were there will know that Bench'd first stuck it's head up over the parapet in September at the Paddy's Valley Pitchcamp training which coincided with the FOWA Roadtrip-Dublin and Web2Ireland Demobar. The feedback from this event was massive and hugely positive and it was very exciting for us to meet with so many of the Web 2.0 community in Ireland all at once. Blognation have a great report about it here. []</p></p>
