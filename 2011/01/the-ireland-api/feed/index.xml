		<description><![CDATA[Hi Martin,

There has been more activity around Open Data recently such as the IIA event, opendata.ie and DERI Open Data hackathon. The change of Gov obviously slowed down any movements from their side. 

I put a call out a few weeks back (http://conoroneill.net/what-new-irish-government-minister-has-been-t) asking who is the relevant Minister and it appears to be Phil Hogan.

Whilst it&#039;s nice to see the LGCSB heading in the right direction, without a big push from the right people, I fear this will remain a techie-only niche activity.

Hopefully we&#039;ll see something from the likes of Gateway Ireland too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention Conor - I have been working on Loc8 Codes now for nearly 6 years so be prepared for the long haul - but Loc8 is a reaction to a need and a demand - so once there is a need/demand - go for it.

		<description><![CDATA[@Paul - there&#039;s nothing to get stuck in to right now - I&#039;m looking to see if I can get some interns working on projects over the Summer under this moniker...prob try to recreate apps that folks have done in other places.

Any thoughts on crowd-sourced apps where role of the authorities in data aggregation and analysis can be obviated? I&#039;ve been thinking of crowd-sourced crime stats, the hospital waiting list use case is interesting (check in on FourSquare when you arrive and tell the system when you&#039;ve finally been seen to???) - there must be more...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m all for this. One of the suggestions I would have is that you &#039;point&#039; it at something the public cares about. For instance &quot;the daft report&quot; is now the real standard in &quot;the state of the property market&quot;. Can we use Phone + App + Photo + Location + Timestamp to encourage people to note their own waiting times in hospitals (step 2 log the amount of times someone spoke to them, asked them for specific information, etc.). Then you get what we call a customer Outside - In mapping of the health service Service Delivery from the customer perspective. Save &quot;the story&quot; and post it. Then make all the Service Delivery touchpoint information available to anyone for analysis. 

Yes, Start with the Contact API, but (if I may be so bold) do something truly eyecatching to get buy in.

I like the way Kildare Street published nuggets such as &quot;TD X Asked 1 Question Last Year&quot;, or &quot;X TD&#039;s Attended This Session&quot;, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks all for the feedback and pointers, keep them coming.

@Paul - The HSE thinks we have two daughters of different ages with the same name. Job number one - sanitize the data!

@Jeremy - Thanks. For the minute I just want to gauge local interest. I hate seeing things half-start and get nowhere due to lack of interest/momentum.

@John T - I think relationships with the right people in the right organisations will be the way to get/free the data we want. That will take far more effort than the technical side.

@John H - The FÃS black hole just gets deeper and deeper doesn&#039;t it?]]></description>
