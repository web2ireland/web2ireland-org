		<description><![CDATA[Thanks very much Alan.

Cost reduction is not the primary objective of supply.ie. The aim is to &#039;source&#039; great local suppliers. 

Currently, this is being achieved by providing each supplier with a &#039;profile page&#039; which is their shop-window on supply.ie. This page allows the supplier describe who they are, where they are and who they currently deal with etc. This page is visible to the buyer when they are making their buying decision.

In future (and the really exciting part), is that buyers and suppliers will have the ability to provide feedback on each other in the form of a quick review. This will then fuel a ratings system facilitating the sourcing of great local suppliers...

Let me know if I can assist you with supply.ie]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of and see the need but quality is a big consideration when selecting a printer.
I have tried many printers over the years and have eventually settled on a personal list with 3 types of printers. 

Expensive - but always do a really lovely finish. 
Reasonable -professional and quick.
Fast - digital for quick short runs.

Not sure how you could rank quotes like that or if the printers would even let you!

Anway best of luck mike I am sure I will try you out.]]></description>
