		<description><![CDATA[Our company is small but growing fast, and outgrew our Excel timesheets. We are now using Pacific Timesheet On-Demand (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacifictimesheet.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.pacifictimesheet.com&lt;/a&gt;) for the last few months and it has really streamlined time tracking, time report and billing. We added payroll integration last month to integrate with our Lawson system, and have seen near 100% adoption across the company.

I hope this helps!
