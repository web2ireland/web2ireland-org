		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I&#039;ve seen that floating around since July/August. I started work at the time been working on one with the traffic data in Dublin: http://mapping.bytesurgery.com/test.php I have the points on the junctions out of the XML file from Dublin City Corp, but never had the time to overlay the congestion data.

There&#039;s someone in college attempting to get something similar to the DART one running on a mobile phone. Should be interesting!]]></description>
