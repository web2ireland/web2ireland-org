		<description><![CDATA[Search Thresher will demonstrate how to enable trust on the Web using a Semantic method called Content Labelling (Metadata). Google and Yahoo! donâ€™t know anything about real personalised searchâ€¦ I know this from the reaction to our stuff from qualified figures in companies such as AOL, VeriSign, Google and others. 

We want to include functionality that will interest a wider audience. So, weâ€™re looking to include FOAF to enable trust for people. Wouldnâ€™t it be cool if people had a URI to identify them on the Web! It would be ever better if you could associate a level of trust to those URIsâ€¦

Is that vague enough to be deemed Web 2.0? ;)

Thanks to our friends at Glaxstar for building the extension.]]></description>
