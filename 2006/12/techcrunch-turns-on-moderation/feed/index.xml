		<description><![CDATA[Mike Arrington routinely deletes comments that criticize products he gives a postive rating to. Specifically if it relates to one of his sponsors. He apparently is yet to come to terms with the spirit of blogging and social networking. His high-handedness clearly obvious in the way he treated Sam. Grow up Mike! TC makes a huge difference. Dont take it down with your arrogance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

I was on a Skype call throughout your exchange of emails with Sam and as such, am aware of the facts. Some of my comments are in response to your response on TechCrunch.co.uk and http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=322 which has attracted more backlash from others.

I certainly wouldnâ€™t have posted such harsh comments if I wasnâ€™t in possession of the facts. Iâ€™m quite passionate about how line management should treat people, especially when theyâ€™re so passionate about their work and have so much support. Itâ€™s all about â€˜peopleâ€™ and â€˜connectingâ€™. The networking scene over on this side of the pond is nothing short of fantastic.

Furthermore, you not only deleted Sam&#039;s last comment on TechCrunch, you stopped me from posting to it and switched on moderation which I found to be dictatorial, or at least, the opposite to what blogging is supposed to represent. 

The comment I made about you exporting your version of democracy to Europe was removed as soon as I realised I made a mistake, for which I apologise â€“ if you find a reference to it, please let me know and Iâ€™ll take care of it immediately. As a sponsor and very active participant in many W3C initiatives, I appreciate and respect the importance of internationalisation. But I also have the same respect for freedom of speech and the right for the small guy to be heard as loudly as the big players.

I certainly wouldnâ€™t like my misplaced comment to detract from the importance that 99% of the blogs Iâ€™ve read, place upon your actions regarding TechCrunch UK &amp; Ireland.

FYI, your actions have been the topic of discussion between me and a few bloggers that you know of, with the view to asking industry if it wants to create a code of conduct for blogging (http://contentlabel.org/ â€“ coming soon). Deleting comments to appease individuals was something that everyone felt particularly strongly against.

Perhaps we can put this behind us soon and work together on helping to enable more trust for bloggers in general - something I was going to focus on anyway.]]></description>
