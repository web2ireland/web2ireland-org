Fergus, as one of the more &quot;progressive&quot; movers-n-shakers (Nooked) on the IRL Web 2.0 scene your comments are well respected. 

I think &quot;Smart&quot; money is a key factor as like any industry there is a huge difference between someone that is in the 10/10 category and others in the 3 out of 10. This applies to VC/angels as well, at least from my experience.

Interesting that Vinod Khosla from Kleiner Perkins (one of the BIG men in the Valley) at the Web 2.0 summit (http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/11/09/distributing-the-future.html) is talking about TOO much money these days (the new Web 2.0 arena).

Not that u have that problem in IRL; but thankfully (and kudos 2 the IT@Cork and all the others that are pushing IRL on the Web2.0 stage) some of that should change as IRL gets more exposure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[as an Irishman in USA and contemplating to return someday, I see a &quot;lack&quot; of early stage funding available in IRL. 
Now this is written mostly from afar (and hence looking at blogs, websites, VC sites, finance circles, google etc.) although I have a few &#039;startup&#039; connections across the waters.
The UK has a similiar issues but not on such a grand scale.

I see EI/IDA doing some good and the &#039;govn&#039; making the right noises just not seen any real concrete results (maybe 2 early 2 tell).

I presume as u indicate those (would b angels) with money in their pockets are getting higher (and potentially less risky) returns from their other investments (property). In that respect it will take quite a bit of correction (signs are there 4 quite some time but not really happened yet) b4 they &quot;need&quot; to go look elsewhere. Also expect they will need some education (and/or brokering) b4 they dabble in &#039;risky&#039; technology startups.
