		<description><![CDATA[Fergus,

Thanks so much for making this happen and I&#039;m excited to see Dublin for the first time. Regarding these one-on-ones. Both Rick and I are looking for people with great ideas about Ireland and what&#039;s going to happen there for entrepreneurs in the next five years or so.  The last thing we want is a powerPoint presentation. Rick may very well circle back later as an investor, but he is coming to Dublin to learn. I&#039;m coming in the hope of hearing great stories about social media company players that will fit into my book.  I am very interested in how culture shapes and changes technology.]]></description>
