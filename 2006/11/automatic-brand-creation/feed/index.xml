		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike, I had every intention of introducing you! I meant to catch up with you but didn&#039;t get a chance.

It was the first thing I suggested to Justin. Will do it when I get a chance tomorrow - living it up like a king at the mo - Haymarket corp. event racing boats and cars :) Sam is attending the Dublin Firefox party tomorrow (14/11) - can you make it? you could say a few words and there will be plenty of very cool Irish companies there!
