		<description><![CDATA[Bill, I wasn&#039;t being critical of you. Just a bit fed up with media reporting focussing on &quot;outside involvement&quot;. There are a lot of indiginous efforts doing hard work too ;-)
Delighted with your support and as I said earlier this week &quot;let&#039;s talk&quot;! Ireland is in a good position for this and we can make Techstars part of it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I should have got the audio book, it takes me months to read even the shortest books at the minute. I&#039;ll see if I can be faster this time and will drop it over to you.

I met him just for a few minutes before the IIA Awards. We&#039;re lucky to have him here, he has the kind of vision that really gets people motivated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can I borrow that copy of Stone Soup when you&#039;re done? :-)

Met Bill at IIA conference the other week and his keynote was really inspirational - one of the best I&#039;ve hard in ages.

It&#039;s great to hear that he&#039;s bringing something like this into Ireland.]]></description>
