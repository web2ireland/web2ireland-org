		<description><![CDATA[Hi Gerry, 

I was so happy for you with the story of Stockbyte and for the difference it made in the digital photography world that we now live inn.... I have started playing around with illustrating and digital photography and think it is something new and different..... I also have few other things in the back of my head that I would like to try (and no it&#039;s not drugs)..... It&#039;s not that often that I do return to Tralee and I say that by choice as I find I&#039;m in a happy place with country and peace of mind..... I never asked for much Gerry when I worked for you as was nothing you could give at that time, an please don&#039;t think I&#039;m asking for or wanting money as I&#039;m not nor would ever ask or make myself look so low.... I only ask if you would be kind enough to replay and give me few mins of your time when I next visit Tralee.

Thanks for taking time to look at my comment on here..... I do hope that this finds you, and it finds you well...

Really looking forward to seeing the live site. Another revolution from Jerry]]></description>
