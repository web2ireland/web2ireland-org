<p>Interesting to see references to local Web2Ireland community in <a href="http://idaireland.com/news-media/press-releases/tanaiste-launches-ida-ire/index.xml">IDA Ireland Horizon 2020 strategy document</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The ICT sector in Ireland is already playing a leading role in showing this model in operation, with Facebook connecting with local application developers through its<br />
Developer Garage programme and Googleâ€™s Code Jam engaging in a similar way.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the sections is very interesting &#8211; titled &#8211; Connect with Tomorrowâ€™s Twitter </p>
<blockquote><p>High growth technology companies have impact hugely disproportional to their size. They are often first to market with new ideas and new business models in digital media, life sciences, mobile technology and financial services. These young companies are the seeds of tomorrowâ€™s multinationals â€“ whether through organic growth or in mergers or acquisitions, often with more established firms. IDA will increase its emphasis and focus on these high potential companies in support of the development of<br />
Ireland as a global innovation hub. IDA has established a dedicated team focused on the needs of these companies. Working with sister agencies and other stakeholders, we will assist these emerging companies with financial support and in making connections in Ireland. These high-growth firms<br />
will become an increasingly important part of Irelandâ€™s innovation ecosystem, linking up with established multinationals in ICT and globally traded businesses; third level institutions and their talented graduates; and indigenous companies of similar scale and potential.</p></blockquote>

<p>In what is a huge boost for the Web2Ireland community, Facebook are setting up their International Headquarters in Ireland. </p>
<p>We had previously covered the proposed setup of <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2008/01/17/facebook-considering-adding-ireland-as-a-friend/">Facebook Operations in Ireland.</a></p>
<p>Dublin will be the centre for Facebookâ€™s international operations and will provide a range of online technical, sales and operations support to Facebookâ€™s users and customers across EMEA region.</p>
<p>Great validation of the talent pool in Ireland &#8211; and congratulation to <a href="http://www.idaireland.com/">IDA Ireland</a> folks for attracting Facebook to Ireland.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/jobs">Facebook jobs in Ireland due </a> <a href="http://tbe.taleo.net/NA3/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=FACEBOOK">are live</a> &#8211; and hopefully we will see local collaborations like a Web2Ireland Facebook Developer Garage  in the near future.</p>
