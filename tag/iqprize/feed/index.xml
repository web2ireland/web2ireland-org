<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/apr/12/google-buys-uk-startup-plink">Despite some other media coverage</a>, Plink is very much Irish (<a href="http://www.solocheck.ie/FreeIrishCompanyReport?companyNumber=476079&#038;companyName=PLINK+SEARCH+LIMITED">registered company in Ireland</a>), and is a <a href="http://www.iqcontent.com/about/news/iq-prize-finalists-announced">past finalist in IQPrize</a>. <a href="http://taint.org/2003/12/10/185721a.html">Colin Farrell has suffered from same confusion as Plink <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </a></p>
<p>Hopefully its the first of many acquisitions by Google in Ireland/Europe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re a little slow with the news but it&#8217;s still worth mentioning and giving some extra background. Robin Blandford of <a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">D4H</a> won the â‚¬10k <a href="http://www.iqprize.ie/">IQPrize</a> last Wednesday and <a href="http://www.plinksearch.net/">Plink</a> won the audience award of â‚¬1k for their elevator pitch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.iqprize.ie/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Decisions for Heroes" src="//iqprize.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/d4h-sml.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>As one of the judges I can honestly say it was both a privilege and a joy to listen to all 8 pitches on Wednesday. Making the final decision was very very difficult due to the quality of all of them.</p>
<p>If you are an investor, I recommend you study <a href="http://iqprize.ie/">each of the 8</a> very closely. It is our belief that several of them will have massive exits in the next 1-2 years. All of the others will have very successful businesses and I look forward to being a customer.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the IQPrize which seems to be impossible to get across to those in power was that it was entirely bottom-up with no cherry-picking or high-potential-labelling or expert-selection or jobs-for-the-boys or who-you-know or what-you-have-done-in-the-past.</p>
<p>Anyone could enter. Anyone.</p>
<p>And because of that we saw the depth of the entrepreneurial spirit in Ireland and the eagerness and hunger to build great businesses as the Zombieconomy collapses around us.</p>
<p>The other critical thing we saw was that many of the applicants had amazing ideas or technology but didn&#8217;t have the business background needed to make it a huge success. Incubation programmes like Genesis and Hothouse are critical here but perhaps many of those who benefited from the the boom of the past few years might like to give something back? They could offer to do more than mentoring and actually come on board with some of these businesses and help them go global. CEOs and VPs of Sales in particular could help enormously.</p>
<p>In 249 biz plans there were maybe 5 lunatics. I hope at least one of those proves to be a visionary and we just didn&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t make the final 8 this year, tighten up your biz plan and have another go when the next event like this appears. There will be some feedback later in the summer from the judges overall on what worked for us and what didn&#8217;t in terms of biz plan. It was interesting that despite our wildly diverse backgrounds, we usually agreed on those points. Hopefully that will help everyone who applied to build a newer better kick-ass plan.</p>
<p>Well done to D4H, well done to Plink and well done everyone who applied.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Press Release on the IQPrize has just gone out and the important bits are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">Decisions For Heroes</a> (Robin Blandford) â€“A web application that saves lives by helping rescue teams record and analyze their rescue operations and training</li>
<li><a href="http://getitkeepit.com/">GetitKeepit.com</a> (Alan Coleman) â€“ A web application to help consumers declutter their lives by offering an online portal for the management and retention of important documentation</li>
<li><a href="http://myhotel.ie/">MyHotel.ie</a> (David and Matt Sherlock) â€“ A website and booking engine that reinvents the traditional  booking model, offering hotels a powerful new marketing channel with no booking fees</li>
<li>Neurosynergy Games (David Delany, Lorraine Boran and Michael Boran) â€“ Innovative online brain training application designed to enhance both intellectual (&#8216;IQ&#8217;) and emotional (&#8216;EQ&#8217;) performance for healthy people and people with specific mental disorders</li>
<li><a href="http://octopied.com/">Octopied</a> (David Behan, Ronan Morris and Michael Flanagan) â€“ A web application for freelancers, helping them manage invoicing, project management, sales and support through one simple and cost-effective tool</li>
<li><a href="http://ourwritersbloc.com/">Our Writersâ€™ Bloc</a> (Owen Gallagher and Karl Quinn) â€“ An online marketplace that connects self-published authors directly with their readers, and facilitates the distribution of material over multiple formats including mobile phones and e-Reader devices</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pendlehouse.com/Default.aspx">Pendle House</a> (Michael Furey) â€“ An online currency exchange marketplace that allows companies and individuals around the world to trade currencies directly with each other, cutting out all transaction costs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plinksearch.net/demo.html">Plink</a> (Mark Cummins, James Philbin) â€“ An image-driven search engine that allows users take a photo of an object with a mobile phone, and automatically retrieve information about it online</li>
</ul>
<p>On July 8th, the final candidates will make a Dragonâ€™s Den type presentation to the judges, followed by a public event where the candidates will be able to make a short elevator pitch to the audience. The Peopleâ€™s Choice Award of â‚¬1000 and the Grand Prize of â‚¬10,000 for the overall winner will be announced at the end of the night.</p>
<p>To add my 2 cents as a judge, I was honestly blown away by the quality of all the biz plans I reviewed. I expected that there&#8217;d be lots of badly thought-out, lunatic fringe stuff but I was completely wrong. 90% of what I read could make a feasible business.</p>
<p>Selecting the final 8 was bloody difficult because there were so many great ones submitted. I fully expect to see a ton of those who submitted plans running highly successful businesses over the next few years. I hope they all go straight to their County Enterprise Board or Enterprise Ireland and give them the same plans they sent us.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who will win the prize but those 8 businesses could easily generate â‚¬100m+ revenues between them.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping IQContent are getting non-stop calls from EI and the CEBs to get access to all the other fantastic plans.</p>
