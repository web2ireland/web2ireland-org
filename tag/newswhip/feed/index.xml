				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know what unmitigated disasters Digg V3 and later were. In a world of Twitter and Facebook they kept thinking it was still 2007. When V3 launched <a href="http://conoroneill.net/quick-thoughts-on-the-new-digg">I said</a> that it should have been built around the popular stories on Twitter since that&#8217;s what people are really interested in, rather than the closed coven of Digg power-users. So I was thrilled to see the recent launch of <a href="http://www.newswhip.com/">NewsWhip</a> which does exactly that.</p>
<p>The site is an aggregation of popular news based on sharing and RTs across Twitter and Facebook. So there is no gaming, no moderation, just a smart algorithm bubbling up the hot news right now. They give a score to a news story by measuring how many Tweets, Likes, Shares, and other interactions it gets.You can filter by the location you are interested in and various categories and sub-categories.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newswhip.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2111 aligncenter" title="NewsWhip" src="//www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newswhip.png" alt="" width="500" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>At the moment the front page is showing some stories on the possible return of Arrested Development. That makes me very happy indeed.</p>
<p>For a great snapshot of interesting news across the realtime web during the day, I think the guys have nailed it.</p>
