				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trinity Entrepreneurial Society (TES) is running a &#8220;Speed Networking&#8221; event  tomorrow in the Atrium in TCD at 2.45pm.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the penultimate leg of the global speed networking tour. The event is aimed at entrepreneurs, academics, students and all members of the business community. The speed networking tour is designed to unleash energy, share ideas and make connections  fast.</p>
<p>The global speed networking tour has visited over 6 continents in the past 3 weeks including places such as Hong Kong, Mexico City, Toronto, Johannesburg, Botswana, Singapore, Santiago, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney and San Francisco. You can find out more <a href="http://www.unleashingideas.org/speednetwork">on the site</a>.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted by <a href="http://www.olibarrett.co.uk/">Oli Barrett</a> an expert speed networker who has travelled around the world in the past few weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a lot of fun and handy for practicing the elevator pitch.</p>
