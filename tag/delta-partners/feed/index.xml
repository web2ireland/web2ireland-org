				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.digitalmines.com/">Digital Mines</a>, a new Irish Cloud Computing provider, <a href="http://blog.digitalmines.com/2011/03/digital-mines-receives-e750000-investment/">has just announced</a> a funding round of €750,000. This includes <a href="http://www.delta.ie/">Delta Partners</a> first investment from their Bank of Ireland start-up and Emerging Sectors equity fund. Enterprise Ireland and existing investors were also part of the round.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitalmines.com/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Digital Mines" src="//blog.digitalmines.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/dm_blog.png" alt="" width="253" height="56" /></a></p>
<p>The company is run by Ed Byrne is who well known to everyone in the web space in Ireland. Ed was General Manager of Hosting 365, which was sold last year to SunGard AS.</p>
<p>The whole idea behind Digital Mines is to take the power and usefulness of cloud services such as Amazon AWS and make them accessible to business users. Currently most cloud offerings required far too much technical knowledge. Digital Mines takes all of that and turns it into a set of one-click operations.</p>
<p>The Delta investment is not just important for Digital Mines, it is also sends a strong message that the Seed Funds in Ireland are out there investing in new and exciting companies despite all the doom and gloom. You can expect to see many more announcements from Shay and the team in Delta in the coming months.</p>
