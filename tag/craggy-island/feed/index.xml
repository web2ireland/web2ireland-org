<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-craggy-island/id372593951?mt=8">&#8220;My Craggy Island&#8221;</a> which was released by <a href="http://www.touristrepublic.com/">Tourist Republic</a> and <a href="http://spoonsafari.com/">Spoon Safari</a> last week will be free to download this weekend.</p>
<p>Craggy Island may be a rugged granite island, off the coast of south-eastern Australia but it is also the TV home of our three favourite priests. While most of the interior shots were filmed in a studio in England, most of the exterior shots were filmed around Ireland and particularly in the beautiful Clare region of Ireland.</p>

Visit the lonely wreck of the plassey ship on Inisheer, have a pint and soak up the atmosphere in Vaughan&#8217;s pub and of course make the pilgrimage to the remote parochial house.</p>
