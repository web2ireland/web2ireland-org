				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/whatclinic-small.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1835" title="WhatClinic.com logo" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/whatclinic-small.png" alt="WhatClinic.com logo" width="600" height="84" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been around three years since we launched our website RevaHealth.com and during that time the most common response to hearing the name was &#8220;Aviva Health?&#8221; or &#8220;Vivas Health?&#8221; or some other brand name that rhymes with Reva. We knew we were onto a loser and that we&#8217;d have to change the name eventually, but we kept putting it off.</p>
<p>Finally, with traffic growing past the 500,000 per month point we decided we&#8217;d have to bite the bullet and after quite a lot of discussion we settled on <a title="health clinic search engine" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/">WhatClinic.com</a>. We figure it&#8217;s easy to remember, hard to mistake (the spelling) and it tells people exactly what the website is about &#8211; helping you to choose a clinic. Hopefully you agree.</p>
<p>As ever we&#8217;re trying to help people find clinics in their local area, like <a title="dublin dentists" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/dentists/ireland/county-dublin">dentists in Dublin</a>, and further afield, like <a title="cosmetic surgery turkey" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/turkey">cosmetic surgery clinics in Turkey</a>. Most of our traffic comes from the UK, Ireland and the US, but in the last month alone we&#8217;ve had visits from 193 countries or territories according to Google Analytics, another reason why the new, simpler name became so important.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve any thoughts about the new name or the service in general, or you&#8217;ve re-branded yourself recently, we&#8217;d love to hear about it in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re a little slow with the news but it&#8217;s still worth mentioning and giving some extra background. Robin Blandford of <a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">D4H</a> won the â‚¬10k <a href="http://www.iqprize.ie/">IQPrize</a> last Wednesday and <a href="http://www.plinksearch.net/">Plink</a> won the audience award of â‚¬1k for their elevator pitch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.iqprize.ie/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Decisions for Heroes" src="//iqprize.ie/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/d4h-sml.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>As one of the judges I can honestly say it was both a privilege and a joy to listen to all 8 pitches on Wednesday. Making the final decision was very very difficult due to the quality of all of them.</p>
<p>If you are an investor, I recommend you study <a href="http://iqprize.ie/">each of the 8</a> very closely. It is our belief that several of them will have massive exits in the next 1-2 years. All of the others will have very successful businesses and I look forward to being a customer.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the IQPrize which seems to be impossible to get across to those in power was that it was entirely bottom-up with no cherry-picking or high-potential-labelling or expert-selection or jobs-for-the-boys or who-you-know or what-you-have-done-in-the-past.</p>
<p>Anyone could enter. Anyone.</p>
<p>And because of that we saw the depth of the entrepreneurial spirit in Ireland and the eagerness and hunger to build great businesses as the Zombieconomy collapses around us.</p>
<p>The other critical thing we saw was that many of the applicants had amazing ideas or technology but didn&#8217;t have the business background needed to make it a huge success. Incubation programmes like Genesis and Hothouse are critical here but perhaps many of those who benefited from the the boom of the past few years might like to give something back? They could offer to do more than mentoring and actually come on board with some of these businesses and help them go global. CEOs and VPs of Sales in particular could help enormously.</p>
<p>In 249 biz plans there were maybe 5 lunatics. I hope at least one of those proves to be a visionary and we just didn&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t make the final 8 this year, tighten up your biz plan and have another go when the next event like this appears. There will be some feedback later in the summer from the judges overall on what worked for us and what didn&#8217;t in terms of biz plan. It was interesting that despite our wildly diverse backgrounds, we usually agreed on those points. Hopefully that will help everyone who applied to build a newer better kick-ass plan.</p>
<p>Well done to D4H, well done to Plink and well done everyone who applied.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Press Release on the IQPrize has just gone out and the important bits are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">Decisions For Heroes</a> (Robin Blandford) â€“A web application that saves lives by helping rescue teams record and analyze their rescue operations and training</li>
<li><a href="http://getitkeepit.com/">GetitKeepit.com</a> (Alan Coleman) â€“ A web application to help consumers declutter their lives by offering an online portal for the management and retention of important documentation</li>
<li><a href="http://myhotel.ie/">MyHotel.ie</a> (David and Matt Sherlock) â€“ A website and booking engine that reinvents the traditional  booking model, offering hotels a powerful new marketing channel with no booking fees</li>
<li>Neurosynergy Games (David Delany, Lorraine Boran and Michael Boran) â€“ Innovative online brain training application designed to enhance both intellectual (&#8216;IQ&#8217;) and emotional (&#8216;EQ&#8217;) performance for healthy people and people with specific mental disorders</li>
<li><a href="http://octopied.com/">Octopied</a> (David Behan, Ronan Morris and Michael Flanagan) â€“ A web application for freelancers, helping them manage invoicing, project management, sales and support through one simple and cost-effective tool</li>
<li><a href="http://ourwritersbloc.com/">Our Writersâ€™ Bloc</a> (Owen Gallagher and Karl Quinn) â€“ An online marketplace that connects self-published authors directly with their readers, and facilitates the distribution of material over multiple formats including mobile phones and e-Reader devices</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pendlehouse.com/Default.aspx">Pendle House</a> (Michael Furey) â€“ An online currency exchange marketplace that allows companies and individuals around the world to trade currencies directly with each other, cutting out all transaction costs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plinksearch.net/demo.html">Plink</a> (Mark Cummins, James Philbin) â€“ An image-driven search engine that allows users take a photo of an object with a mobile phone, and automatically retrieve information about it online</li>
</ul>
<p>On July 8th, the final candidates will make a Dragonâ€™s Den type presentation to the judges, followed by a public event where the candidates will be able to make a short elevator pitch to the audience. The Peopleâ€™s Choice Award of â‚¬1000 and the Grand Prize of â‚¬10,000 for the overall winner will be announced at the end of the night.</p>
<p>To add my 2 cents as a judge, I was honestly blown away by the quality of all the biz plans I reviewed. I expected that there&#8217;d be lots of badly thought-out, lunatic fringe stuff but I was completely wrong. 90% of what I read could make a feasible business.</p>
<p>Selecting the final 8 was bloody difficult because there were so many great ones submitted. I fully expect to see a ton of those who submitted plans running highly successful businesses over the next few years. I hope they all go straight to their County Enterprise Board or Enterprise Ireland and give them the same plans they sent us.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who will win the prize but those 8 businesses could easily generate â‚¬100m+ revenues between them.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping IQContent are getting non-stop calls from EI and the CEBs to get access to all the other fantastic plans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.propelprogramme.ie/">The Propel Programme</a> is run by Enterprise Ireland and is designed to provide entrepreneurs with the necessary business skills to establish a successful global business. (Note that URL is not loading for me at the moment)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1108  aligncenter" title="propel" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/propel-300x70.jpg" alt="propel" width="300" height="70" /></p>
<p>Propel will run for one year and is open to those currently located, or planning to locate, in one of the six border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan or Sligo.</p>
<p>They will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial support of up to â‚¬30,000 (was â‚¬38k until recent cutbacks)</li>
<li>Business start-up training</li>
<li>Specialised expertise and mentoring</li>
<li>Access to potential investors</li>
<li>Access to local and global contacts and networks</li>
<li>Hot desk facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume Propel was modelled on the huge successes of Genesis, Hothouse, M50, EAC etc rather than being created from scratch by consultants.Â If you are in Munster, applications forÂ <a href="http://www.gep.ie/">Genesis</a> are still being accepted.</p>
<p>Final date for receipt of applications for Propel is 24 April 2009. Email startup@propelprogramme.ie or call (01) 605 9180</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The site goes live at 2pm today. It&#8217;s very simple, send <a href="http://www.iqcontent.com/">IQContent</a> a 5-page business plan that shows how your will turn your idea into a great online business.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.iqprize.ie/"><img class="aligncenter" title="IQPrize" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/iqprize.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="190" /></a></p>
