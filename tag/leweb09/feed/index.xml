				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I usually have these posts written within a day or two of <a href="http://www.leweb.net/">Le Web</a> but other commitments slowed me down this year. 2009 saw the 6th Le Web (my 4th) and it was easily the best ever. Loic &amp; Geraldine can rest easy knowing 2010 will be totally over-subscribed.</p>
<p>People go to Le Web for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Meetings/Deals</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Pitching</li>
</ul>
<p>I went as an official blogger to the event but with intentions of doing all of the above.Â It was a real pleasure to be on the official blogger team and a big thanks to <a href="http://climbtothestars.org/">Stephanie Booth</a> who organised all of that brilliantly.</p>
<p>The Irish contingent was tiny with <a href="http://www.cloudsplit.com/">Joe Drumgoole</a>, John Peavoy, Colm Long of Facebook and <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/business">myself</a> flying the flag. Whilst I know the tickets are very expensive, it&#8217;s a pity there wasn&#8217;t a bigger showing. The IDA attended last year but I didn&#8217;t spot them this year. Le Web is <strong><em>the</em></strong> European web business/tech event and I happily skipped every other pay-for event this year to ensure I could go.</p>
<p>The opening session with Jack Dorsey set the perfect tone for the two days. The guy who created the global phenomenon of Twitter showed off his new startup <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. This is P2P payments with a credit card swipe that plugs into the headphone socket of your phone and an application which allows others to pay you. I didn&#8217;t quite get how revolutionary this was until I saw it in action (despite the terrible demo problems he had).</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="386" id="utv335225" name="utv_n_970482"><param name="flashvars" value="loc=%2F&amp;autoplay=false&amp;vid=2747998" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2747998" /><embed flashvars="loc=%2F&amp;autoplay=false&amp;vid=2747998" width="480" height="386" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" id="utv335225" name="utv_n_970482" src="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2747998" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></object></p>
<p>There are often complaints that they have too many Americans speaking at the event. I take the opposite view, since this is one of the few opportunities for those of us who don&#8217;t regularly travel to the US to see these guys speak and perhaps meet them. Standout highlights for me were Tony Hsieh from <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> and Gary Vaynerchuk from <a href="http://tv.winelibrary.com/">Wine Library TV</a> but there were plenty of others including David Hornik from <a href="http://www.augustcap.com/">August Capital</a> and Chris Sacca of <a href="http://lowercasellc.com/">Lowercase Capital</a>.</p>
<p>I have ordered the Zappos Culture book that Tony mentioned (just email ceo@zappos.com and theyâ€™ll post you a copy) and downloaded the Tribal Leadership audiobookÂ <a href="http://about.zappos.com/tribal">from here</a> (use California 90210 for your address in the registration screen). Wonderful stuff.</p>

<p>Gary (NSFW audio):</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="386" id="utv815044" name="utv_n_874003"><param name="flashvars" value="loc=%2F&amp;autoplay=false&amp;vid=2851904" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2851904" /><embed flashvars="loc=%2F&amp;autoplay=false&amp;vid=2851904" width="480" height="386" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" id="utv815044" name="utv_n_874003" src="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2851904" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></object></p>
<p>Those who worked best on stage were generally the contrary bastards. In that batch I&#8217;d include <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">Mike Arrington</a>, <a href="http://www.lukaszgadowski.com/">Lukasz Gadowski</a>, <a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/">Andrew Keen</a>, <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com/">Paul Carr</a>, <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/">Dave McClure</a> and <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/">Martin Varsavsky</a>. Guys who are not afraid to call bullshit on things but who also see potential in the most interesting of places. The sessions that they were involved in were far more useful and fruitful than the usual cheerleader echo-chamber gang.</p>
<p>In fact, the echo-chamber gang were the only real let-down of the two days. We&#8217;ve all heard their schtick non-stop for the past few years and it&#8217;s grown old and boring. I&#8217;d love to see a bunch of new US faces coming over next year who have something new to say.</p>
<p>The real-time theme of the event did become a bit of an unbearable Twitter love-in at times to the detriment of many other exciting things happening in the real-time web. As someone pointed out on a TWiT podcast recently, more people play Farmville on Facebook than are users of Twitter.</p>
<p>For those who think Irish startups can&#8217;t compete at the highest levels on an international stage, just watch <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/12/09/cloudsplit-at-le-web-2/">Joe Drumgoole&#8217;s pitch</a> in the Startup Competition. I was shocked that Cloudsplit didn&#8217;t get the win but rumour has it that Thierry Henry was one of the judges <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Over a couple of days I met entrepreneurs, bloggers, VCs, techies and business people. That&#8217;s why I go. The energy in that room recharges my batteries and reminds me that fantastic startups are being built all over Europe and we all have more in common than we think.</p>
<p>Even if I didn&#8217;t get to announce our first US customer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nathalie Kosciusko Morizet, Minister of State to the Prime Minister, with responsibility for Forward Planning, Assessment of Public Policies and Development of the Digital Economy, speaking at Le Web with Loic Le Meur in Paris today.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">â‚¬2B for broadband upgrades in France out of a â‚¬4B budget to invest in the digital future.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>We reduce the price of booze and come up with meaningless buzzwords like Smart Economy.</p>

<p>This is a great achievement for Joe and Eamonn Leonard and we&#8217;ll be live-tweeting and blogging the entire event from the day before to the day after.</p>
<p>We know of at least one Irish company that secured investment after their appearance at Le Web in previous years. Let&#8217;s hope we hear similar from the guys.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a quiet year for many people on the conference front but there is one event that many of us just can&#8217;t miss, and that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.leweb.net/">Le Web</a>. It&#8217;s not just the brilliant speakers that Loic and Geraldine manage to get, it&#8217;s the battery recharge we need to prepare us for the new year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leweb.net/"><img alt="" src="http://www.leweb.net/sites/default/files/userfiles/image/banner-300x250(1).jpg" title="Le Web 2009" class="aligncenter" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the venue hiccups last year, I still find myself referring to Le Web 2008 regularly. Marissa on the importance of local to Google, Dave Morin on Facebook Connect and Christine Lagarde on startups in France. </p>
<p>Just check out <a href="http://www.leweb.net/program/speakers">this year&#8217;s speakers</a> and tell me you&#8217;re not excited by that line-up. It&#8217;s the style of event where you can easily chat to many of these people and meet them year after year. Apart from the learning and general networking, Le Web is a place where deals are done.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be covering the full two days on Web2Ireland and let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t take down Twitter with the volume of updates!</p>
