				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been finding it hard to keep this news under my hat since the idea was first floated a few months back. There will be an Ireland Pavilion at <a href="http://www.leweb.net/">Le Web</a> in Paris this year! This is just an absolutely brilliant idea and huge kudos goes to all of those in <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/">Enterprise Ireland</a> who conceived the idea and then got full support for it both internally and from the IDA.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.leweb.net/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1873  aligncenter" title="Le Web" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/leweb_logo.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.leweb.net/"></a><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1874  aligncenter" title="Enterprise Ireland" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Logo_NoStrapLine.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="78" /></a></p>
<p>Le Web is the most important conference about the web in Europe every year. You will not see a more impressive collection of heavy hitters in one place anywhere else. It&#8217;s the kind of place where you can meet people like Marissa Meyer or Niklas ZennstrÃ¶m or Fred Wilson. My trivial claim to fame is that I think I&#8217;m the only Irish person to attend every year since 2006 and I&#8217;ve watched it getting better and better.</p>
<p>This year some of the speakers on December 8th and 9th include Dennis Crowley, JP Rangaswami, Toni Schneider and Carlos Ghosn.</p>
<p>The importance of Ireland having its own stand at Le Web cannot be underestimated. The first country ever to have a pavilion like this at the show. One place where global businesses, VCs, other European/US start-ups and leading tech bloggers can see the best of Irish web start-ups. One place where you can point people to in the coming weeks and say &#8220;we&#8217;ll be there, pop on over for a coffee&#8221;.</p>
<p>A problem with giant events like Le Web is that co-ordinating meetings can be a nightmare. People are being pulled in every direction and we are all vying for our own little bit of attention. This stand solves that problem in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>I am convinced this genius move will get a ton of coverage from all the attending press. Who wouldn&#8217;t be intrigued by this?  After all the relentless bad news about Ireland in the global press where we allowed a cabal of innumerate imbeciles to rape our country, this gives journos a totally new, positive growth story to tell. &#8220;Ireland may be screwed now but these start-ups are re-building it from the ground up&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, interested?</p>
<p>The EI package is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full LE WEB pass, giving you access to all the seminars, networking events and competitions over the two days</li>
<li>Use of a dedicated 18mÂ² meeting place/demo area which your company can use to meet with key contacts and demo your solution.</li>
<li>A drinks reception on the Irish pavilion on the evening of 8th December for EI clients and your guests.</li>
<li>In the run up to LE WEB, EI overseas offices will endeavour to link your company in with influential people from overseas markets that will be coming to LE WEB.</li>
<li>Your companyâ€™s profile and contact details in Enterprise Irelandâ€™s Internet marketing materials designed specifically for the event</li>
</ul>
<p>EI is providing this at a totally knock-down price.</p>
<p>There is really only one limitation which is that you must be an EI client to apply to be on the stand. There are only 14 slots so not everyone is going to get through. To apply, simply contact Karen Hallez in the EI Paris office at Karen.Hallez@enterprise-ireland.com and she will send you an application form and details on the cost etc. <strong>They really need to get this wrapped up in the next few days so apply now.</strong></p>
<p>Also don&#8217;t forget that this is the last weekend where you can enter the <a href="http://leweb.producteev.com/home.php">Le Web Startup Competition</a>.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ve been lauding Enterprise Ireland a lot recently, but with good reason. Of all the state and semi-state bodies I&#8217;ve dealt with since the country went to hell, EI and all its staff are the ones that more than rose to the challenge and they are impressing me with every single encounter. Right now, the way EI operates shows the best of what the public sector and private sector working together should be about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today saw the launch of a new joint initiative between Enterprise Ireland and the <a href="http://www.alliance.ie/">Internet Growth Alliance</a> headed by Colm Lyon of Realex called <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/igap/">iGAP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/igap/"><img alt="" src="//www.enterprise-ireland.com/NR/rdonlyres/B01E5B38-5507-4FD8-A62B-5061689ADECA/0/iGAPtopbanner.JPG" title="iGAP" class="aligncenter" width="556" height="62" /></a></p>
<p>Over 6 months from November 2009 onwards, iGAP will focus on practical learning and intensive support for Irish web businesses who wish to grow aggressively at an international level. </p>
<p>The programme will culminate in a funding pitch scenario where the participants be put to the test by experienced venture capital and angel investors. Participants will also be partnered with an experienced business leader who will act as an implementation coach to ensure the programme learning is embedded into the company.</p>
<p>The full cost of the Internet Growth Acceleration Programme is â‚¬10k per company (2 participants). Enterprise Ireland will fund 80% of this cost leaving a company fee of â‚¬2k.</p>
<p>A very welcome aspect of the programme is that it is open to to non-clients of Enterprise Ireland too so it won&#8217;t be a love-in of the usual suspects. The presence of some real heavy hitters in the industry means this really is a very serious initiative and has tons of upside for those who participate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/igap/How+to+Participate.htm">Closing Date</a> for Applications is October 16th.</p>

<p>This topic came up in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/933026">VC discussion</a> at last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/">LeWeb</a> &#8211; and Ireland was mentioned as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/">Enterprise Ireland</a> in a <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/News/Press+Releases/2008/PressJun032008.htm">June press release</a> provided an update on the <a href="http://www.entemp.ie/press/2007/20070722.htm">2007-2012 Seed and Venture Capital (VC) Programme</a></p>
<p>To date â‚¬148.75m has been committed to 8 Seed &#038; Venture Funds. </p>
<p>Of these, 6 have completed first closings, including </p>
<p>- Delta Partners [100m fund]<br />
- AIB Seed Capital Fund [30m fund]<br />
- Atlantic Bridge Ventures<br />
- Kernel Capital Partners [70m fund]<br />
- Fountain Healthcare Partners &#8211; not for technology &#8211; life science fund.<br />
- NCB Ventures &#8211; [75m fund] &#8211; closed its fund in November.</p>
<p>â‚¬275m funds readily available &#8211; and from EI press release &#8211; 8 funds [2 funds still to close] have succeeded in raising in excess of â‚¬500m for investment in early stage and growing companies.</p>
<p>Enterprise Ireland announced that â‚¬30m is remaining and is now available for co-investment &#8211; and a recent advertisement in the <a href="http://www.ft.com/">FT</a> is targetting UK VCs for partnership.</p>
<p>Given the recent <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/attacking-the-recession/">UK news @ Government funds for NESTA</a>, the UKâ€™s National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, will oversee a Â£1bn emergency venture capital fund aimed at pre-revenue technology start-up firms &#8211; and the <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/12/08/is-this-1bn-from-nesta-new-money-will-private-equity-really-join-in-and-why-is-nesta-not-answering-their-email/">follow on discussion</a> &#8211; We&#8217;d like to hear from Web2Ireland companies who have raised monies from these EI backed funds [make sure you update your Crunchbase details]</p>
