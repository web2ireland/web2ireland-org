				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.being-digital.com/">Being-Digital</a> conference is on in London on June 10th. They are looking for 30 start-ups to present to a audience of 250 VC&#8217;s, entrepreneurs,  Angel Investors, CEOs of the internet businesses and Internet media/press.</p>
<p>There will be 7 core discussion themes in the main auditorium &#8211; Search, Advertising, Identity, Social, Location, Retail and Content &#8211; and a dedicated &#8216;Demo room&#8217; in which the 30 selected companies will demo their services and products to delegates throughout the day.</p>
<p>Demo Tickets are normally Â£895 but they are offering them for Â£500 which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 stand in the Demo room &#8211; this will be a dedicated to you all day</li>
<li>1 x full delegate ticket (for the main auditorium)</li>
<li>1 x demo room ticket (for a second person to attend)</li>
<li>1 x 1 minute pitch to audience of 200+ on the main stage following the speaker/panel session most relevant to your company (eg: social, search, advertising etc.)</li>
<li>Your 1min pitch will be filmed and the video will be on their website, along with your details</li>
<li>Evening networking reception</li>
<li>There is also a competition running for best one minute demo pitch as voted for by delegates on the day &#8211; prize includes hardware, software and consultancy time</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst Â£500 may seem like a lot, it looks like reasonable value to me compared to lots of other conferences. It is also highly targetted rather than just being a general &#8220;web conf&#8221;. And with DEMOÂ  costing $18000&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve just realised that PutPlace are already signed-up!</p>
