				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love posting good news and this is just wonderful to hear. Niall Harbison and the crew at <a href="http://www.ifoods.tv/">iFoods</a> have just <a href="http://www.niallh.com/?p=231">announced a €400k investment</a>.</p>

<p>It proves that great businesses with a world class team can still secure serious money. We&#8217;ve been fans of the iFoods concept since day one. They are going to be serious players in the food web-site niche. <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1006846">eMarketer</a> did an article on this during the week.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="eMarketer" src="//www.emarketer.com/images/chart_gifs/099001-100000/099478.gif" alt="" width="324" height="191" /></p>
<p>According to comScore, food sites attracted 45.6 million unique visitors in September 2008, up 10% from 2007more than double the rate of total Internet growth in the US.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst the funding environment is very very tough right now, we are still seeing glimmers of light in the gloom. </p>
<p>The latest is <a href="http://www.dbtwangblog.com/">dbTwang</a>, a site for guitar owners, which <a href="http://bohanna.typepad.com/pureplay/2008/12/dbtwang-angel-round-closed-today.html">closed its Angel round</a> yesterday. Keith Bohanna and co-founder Fintan Blake-Kelly worked for many months with new director Gerry McQuaid (ex-O2) to raise the funds.</p>
<p>They are using <a href="http://www.contrast.ie/">Contrast</a> for the design of dbTwang and <a href="http://www.lunarlogicpolska.com/">Lunar Logic</a> in Krakow for the development, aiming for early closed beta around the 3rd week of February.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ruth Spencer from The <a href="http://www.ejc.net/">European Journalism Centre (EJC)</a> contacted me to let us know about The European Blogging Competition they are launching in Brussels from 25th to 27th of January coming.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="ThinkAboutIt" src="//thinkaboutit.eu/press/banner_468x60.png" alt="" width="468" height="60" /></p>
<p>The theme is TH!NK ABOUT IT and the focus of the competition is the European Parliament Elections 2009. EJC wants to offer a platform for journalism students, aspiring journalists and bloggers to express their views on European topics as well as to report and cover the elections.</p>
<p>They want to have three bloggers from each country attending the launch event and will cover the travel costs. The timeline is:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Launch event: 25 January, 2009 &#8211; 27 January, 2009</li>
<li>Blogging: 1 February, 2009 &#8211; 9 June, 2009</li>
<li>Competition results: 12 June, 2009</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If this is of interest to you, read all the details and apply at <a href="http://www.thinkaboutit.eu/">www.thinkaboutit.eu</a></p>
<p>If you are wondering what this has to do with Web2Ireland, I&#8217;d simply say that the direction the EU takes over the next few years, particularly in how it deals with a global recession, will have direct impact on start-ups here.</p>
