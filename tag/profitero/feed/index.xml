<p>The founders, Kanstantsin Chernysh &#038; Alex Usikov are both originally from Minsk, Belarus. Profitero founders are serial entrepreneursin online retail and SEO with strong mathematical backgrounds and expertise in high-performance algorithms, product classification and data mining. </p>
<p>The team had the following thoughts on Seedcamp:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked a lot with Seedcamp mentors in July &#8211; September. On one hand, we experienced excitement from investors and mentors about our ideas and technology. On the other hand, we found some good advice on retail problems and product areas to focus on.</p></blockquote>
<p>The team are working with a variety of UK retailers that have already signed up for the service, like Debenhams, Warehouse Express, The Hut Group, House of Fraser, CleverBox and others. </p>
