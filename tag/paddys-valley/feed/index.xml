				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year&#8217;s very successful <a href="http://www.webmission.co.uk/">WebMission</a> by UK startups to Silicon Valley followed in the footsteps of the equally successful <a href="http://www.paddysvalley.org/">Paddy&#8217;s Valley</a> several months previously. We&#8217;ve been contacted by James Lawn to let everyone know that Irish start-ups are very welcome on this year&#8217;s trip.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="WebMission" src="//webmission.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/themes/webmission/i/logo.gif" alt="" width="200" height="71" /></p>
<p>They want to bring UK &amp; Irelandâ€™s top 20 fast-growing Enterprise Web Companies to San Francisco from 28 Mar to 3 Apr. Some good sponsorship means that you&#8217;d only have to pay for your flight and hotel. A word in the ear of your Enterprise Ireland D.A. may even cover half of that.</p>
<p>I have to say, the trip looks fantastic. This is what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitated meetings with key US investors</li>
<li>Meet and mingle with key Silicon Valley movers and shakers relevant to your organisation and growth plans</li>
<li>Discuss your business with leading journalists</li>
<li>Spend quality time with like-minded people in the valley</li>
<li>Explore how to succeed and grow in the US market</li>
<li>Attend Web 2.0 Expo which occurs during the same week</li>
<li>Significant VP-level engagement with WebMission sponsors</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The entry requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be an Enterprise 2.0 company</li>
<li>Be innovative</li>
<li>Be headquartered in the UK or Ireland</li>
<li>Have 2 years trading history, or failing that, compelling fast-track potential through management team etc</li>
<li>Be able to provide references from key sponsors/industry players</li>
<li>Able to demonstrate some commitment to sustainable business practices (eg, positive environmental, social or economic outputs)</li>
<li>Be ready to do or grow business in the US OR potentially attractive to a US investor.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to apply, have a look at <a href="http://www.webmission.co.uk/">www.webmission.co.uk</a></p>
