				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know what unmitigated disasters Digg V3 and later were. In a world of Twitter and Facebook they kept thinking it was still 2007. When V3 launched <a href="http://conoroneill.net/quick-thoughts-on-the-new-digg">I said</a> that it should have been built around the popular stories on Twitter since that&#8217;s what people are really interested in, rather than the closed coven of Digg power-users. So I was thrilled to see the recent launch of <a href="http://www.newswhip.com/">NewsWhip</a> which does exactly that.</p>
<p>The site is an aggregation of popular news based on sharing and RTs across Twitter and Facebook. So there is no gaming, no moderation, just a smart algorithm bubbling up the hot news right now. They give a score to a news story by measuring how many Tweets, Likes, Shares, and other interactions it gets.You can filter by the location you are interested in and various categories and sub-categories.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newswhip.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2111 aligncenter" title="NewsWhip" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/newswhip.png" alt="" width="500" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>At the moment the front page is showing some stories on the possible return of Arrested Development. That makes me very happy indeed.</p>
<p>For a great snapshot of interesting news across the realtime web during the day, I think the guys have nailed it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vinny Glennon of <a href="http://useamap.com/">UseAMap</a> and <a href="http://justroutes.com/">JustRoutes</a> has now launched a nice news aggregation site</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to create a site which solely focused on News. My intention is to be able to see the breaking news throughout the day from each country at a glance, without overloading my RSS Reader. The end result is <a href="http://4topnews.com/" target="_blank">4topnews.com</a> which picks up the news from all over the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m with Vinny on the RSS overload thing. Most general news sites simply generate too many stories in their feed every day. I currently use NetVibes to check out the top headlines a few times a day but I&#8217;ll be trying this out too.</p>
<p>The blog is at <a href="http://blog.4topnews.com/" target="_blank">blog.4topnews.com</a></p>
