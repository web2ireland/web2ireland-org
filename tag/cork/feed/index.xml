				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week was the last Open Coffee for Cork for the year. It was assumed that people wouldn&#8217;t be free to attend a last Open Coffee on the 19th. This is a poll to see if anyone would be interested in attending. It could be a demo slot for someone if they would like to show off a new or existing app or it could be a social one in Luigi malones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been over two years since the last one, but BarCamp is finally coming <a href="http://www.barcampcork.com/">back to Cork</a>. It&#8217;s soon, very soon, only four weeks away. The venue is the lovely Webworks building in the City Centre, just like the last time.</p>
<p>We have a strong vision for this event and we need your help to make it happen on the day. Please read <a href="http://www.barcampcork.com/">the first set of posts</a> and give us your feedback. If you think you&#8217;ll be attending, please <a href="http://www.barcampcork.com/register">register</a>. As always with BarCamps, it is completely free with the costs being taken care of by our kind sponsors.</p>
<p>If you wish to sponsor or help, please read the &#8220;<a href="http://www.barcampcork.com/2008/09/29/what-we-need/">what we need</a>&#8221; post.</p>
<p>We have two mottos for BarCampCork II &#8220;talking with, not talking at&#8221; and &#8220;less talking, more doing&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what a BarCamp/Unconference is or have never attended one, here is a simple description from the main BarCamp site:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every attendee of BarCamp is expected to contribute in some way. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have to give a talk. But at the very least, you should take part in lots of the discussions that occur and share the knowledge you have in your area of expertise.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to see you down in Cork and we encourage anyone based outside of Ireland who reads Web2Ireland to consider flying in for the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barcampcork.com/register">Sign-up now</a>.</p>
