				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ruth Spencer from The <a href="http://www.ejc.net/">European Journalism Centre (EJC)</a> contacted me to let us know about The European Blogging Competition they are launching in Brussels from 25th to 27th of January coming.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="ThinkAboutIt" src="//thinkaboutit.eu/press/banner_468x60.png" alt="" width="468" height="60" /></p>
<p>The theme is TH!NK ABOUT IT and the focus of the competition is the European Parliament Elections 2009. EJC wants to offer a platform for journalism students, aspiring journalists and bloggers to express their views on European topics as well as to report and cover the elections.</p>
<p>They want to have three bloggers from each country attending the launch event and will cover the travel costs. The timeline is:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Launch event: 25 January, 2009 &#8211; 27 January, 2009</li>
<li>Blogging: 1 February, 2009 &#8211; 9 June, 2009</li>
<li>Competition results: 12 June, 2009</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If this is of interest to you, read all the details and apply at <a href="http://www.thinkaboutit.eu/">www.thinkaboutit.eu</a></p>
<p>If you are wondering what this has to do with Web2Ireland, I&#8217;d simply say that the direction the EU takes over the next few years, particularly in how it deals with a global recession, will have direct impact on start-ups here.</p>
