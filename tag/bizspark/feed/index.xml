				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Guest Post: Paul Browne is a Development Advisor at <a href="http://www.bestconnected.ie/" target="_blank">Enterprise Ireland (EI),</a> working withÂ  Irish Software companies to increase exports, and export  led jobs. A key area is <a href="http://www.bestconnected.ie/tag/saas/" target="_blank">Cloud and Software as a Service)</a></em></p>
<p>You may have already seen the posts on Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s  BestConnected blog about the work that <a href="http://www.bestconnected.ie/tag/microsoft/" target="_blank">Enterprise Ireland and Microsoft are doing</a> to help the Entrepreneur  Community in Ireland. One of the companies benefitting from this  approach is <a href="http://www.hrlocker.com/" target="_blank">HR Locker</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hrlocker.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.hrlocker.com/images/hrlocker_logo.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>HR Locker is aÂ  web 2.0 provider of HR Solutions to Business. Thatâ€™s  HR as in Employee Records, TimeSheets andÂ  compliance (making sure  everybody has a suitable contract). Today, at the <a href="http://www.bestconnected.ie/will-irish-companies-make-the-cut-at-the-microsoft-bizspark-european-summit/" target="_blank">Microsoft Bizspark European Conference</a>, John Dennehy from HR Locker got shortlisted into the Top 18 Startups in Europe.</p>
<p>As part of the prize, John got the chance to pitch the HR Locker Business to a panel including Brent Hoberman (founder LastMinute.com), Loic LeMeur (Seesmic), Stefan Glaenzer (former chairman Last.FM) , and 8 other seasoned VC&#8217;s and investors. On offer for the best business model / pitch from the 18 companies is a â‚¬10,000 cash prize.</p>
<p>Prior to founding HR Locker, John John has worked in the Internet sector for the past 14 years. He co-founded Upstart Games, a global developer and  publisher of mobile  phone games, which was acquired in Nov 2006. The  company had offices in  Tokyo, Beijing, New York, LA, Dublin and Cork.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s view on HR Locker and Enterprise Ireland</p>
<blockquote><p>BizSpark Network Partner Enterprise Ireland is an excellent example of an organisation that is helping to nurture next-generation start-ups.Â  Microsoft and Enterprise Ireland collaborate to help entrepreneurs in Ireland to maximise the opportunities available to them. Outside the USA, Ireland is host to the largest BizSpark community.</p>
<p>One example is HR Locker, one of the finalists at this yearâ€™s European Investor Summit.Â  HR Locker has benefited from being part of BizSpark and has received business and financial support from Enterprise Ireland (see separate profile).Â Â  Other BizSpark members that work with both Microsoft and Enterprise Ireland include TradeFacilitate and InishTech.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/gary-fallon/0/2b2/900" target="_blank">Gary Fallon, Country Manager, Enterprise Ireland France</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft have played a key part with Enterprise Ireland&#8217;s software clients, encouraging them to innovate and helping them to access new markets. Microsoft has consistently supported many of our software companies throughout their development and is a key platform for supporting them in developing new business opportunities in the French market.</p></blockquote>
