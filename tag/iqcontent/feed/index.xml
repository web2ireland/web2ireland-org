<p>Today they announced the panel of judges for its internet start-up competition, the iQ Prize. Global heavyweights Google, Microsoft and Facebook are all represented on the judging panel, alongside local internet heroes Daft, Statcounter and Loudervoice.</p>
<p>With 6 days to go to the deadline, 63 entries have already been submitted. </p>
<p>The judges are:</p>
<p>Â·       Aodhan Cullen, founder &#038; CEO, StatCounter</p>
<p>Â·       Colm Long, Head of Online Operations (EMEA), Facebook</p>
<p>Â·       Conor Oâ€™Neill, co-founder &#038; CEO, LouderVoice</p>

<p>iQ Content Managing Director Morgan McKeagney will also sit on the panel, but in a non-executive capacity.</p>
<p>The iQ Prize is an open competition for the best business plan for an internet start-up, with a no-strings-attached grand prize of 10,000 euro. Potential applicants still have until May 12th (6 days and counting!) to send in a brief 5-page business plan to show that they have what it takes to turn their idea into a great online business.</p>
