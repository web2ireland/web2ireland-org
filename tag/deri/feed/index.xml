				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A business breakfast hosted by <a href="http://mhc.ie/">Mason Hayes+Curran</a>, in association with the <a href="http://www.software.ie/">Irish Software Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.deri.ie/">Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)</a>, about the legal challenges and commercial possibilities of the Semantic Web, the next evolution of the World Wide Web on Wednesday 25th November between 8.00  9.45am.   This is a must attend event for anyone in the technology sector as well as those in business and the public sector who use the Internet to interface with their clients and the customers they serve.</p>

Through the work of the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI) at NUIG, Ireland has become a central player in developing the protocols and technologies which will play a central role in the development of what are now know as semantic technologies.</p>
