				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now this is something I could seriously do with.</p>
<p>The guys at Dial2Do <a href="http://blog.dial2do.com/2009/02/13/dial2do-and-southwing-announce-revolutionary-hands-free-devices-for-drivers/">have announced</a>Â the Voice Assistant Service with Bluetooth headset manufacturer SouthWing, at MWC in Barcelona.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Dial2Do" src="//dial2do.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/southwing-sf605-voice-assis.jpg?w=480&amp;h=365" alt="" width="480" height="364" /></p>
<p>Drivers just push a button on their headset or carkit and speak to send text messages, send and listen to emails, record reminders and more. Powered by Dial2Doâ€™s Voice Platform, the service is a boost for anyone who wants to make best use of their time in the car, but stay safe and legal behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Dial2Do will be demonstrating the service at the Mobile Monday Peer Awards Barcelona, where they have been shortlisted in the Early Stage Startup category.</p>
