				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fr.techcrunch.com/">Techcrunch France editor</a> &#8211; and <a href="http://lgilab.typepad.com/">LGiLab VC in Israel</a> &#8211; Ouriel Ohayon has a great piece on <a href="http://ouriel.typepad.com/myblog/2008/12/can-governments.html">Can governments become good VCs?</a></p>
<p>This topic came up in <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/933026">VC discussion</a> at last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/">LeWeb</a> &#8211; and Ireland was mentioned as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/">Enterprise Ireland</a> in a <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/News/Press+Releases/2008/PressJun032008.htm">June press release</a> provided an update on the <a href="http://www.entemp.ie/press/2007/20070722.htm">2007-2012 Seed and Venture Capital (VC) Programme</a></p>
<p>To date â‚¬148.75m has been committed to 8 Seed &#038; Venture Funds. </p>
<p>Of these, 6 have completed first closings, including </p>
<p>- Delta Partners [100m fund]<br />
- AIB Seed Capital Fund [30m fund]<br />
- Atlantic Bridge Ventures<br />
- Kernel Capital Partners [70m fund]<br />
- Fountain Healthcare Partners &#8211; not for technology &#8211; life science fund.<br />
- NCB Ventures &#8211; [75m fund] &#8211; closed its fund in November.</p>
<p>â‚¬275m funds readily available &#8211; and from EI press release &#8211; 8 funds [2 funds still to close] have succeeded in raising in excess of â‚¬500m for investment in early stage and growing companies.</p>
<p>Enterprise Ireland announced that â‚¬30m is remaining and is now available for co-investment &#8211; and a recent advertisement in the <a href="http://www.ft.com/">FT</a> is targetting UK VCs for partnership.</p>
<p>Given the recent <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/attacking-the-recession/">UK news @ Government funds for NESTA</a>, the UKâ€™s National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, will oversee a Â£1bn emergency venture capital fund aimed at pre-revenue technology start-up firms &#8211; and the <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/12/08/is-this-1bn-from-nesta-new-money-will-private-equity-really-join-in-and-why-is-nesta-not-answering-their-email/">follow on discussion</a> &#8211; We&#8217;d like to hear from Web2Ireland companies who have raised monies from these EI backed funds [make sure you update your Crunchbase details]</p>
