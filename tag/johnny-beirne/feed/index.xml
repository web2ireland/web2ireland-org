				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are apps/sites I like and apps/sites I love. <a href="http://www.downloadmusic.ie/">DownloadMusic</a> is in the latter category. One of those businesses that just nails the elevator pitch. As soon as you hear how it works, you get it.Â </p>
<p>Johnny Beirne is the guy behind it and he has built something of perfect simplicity. Buy independent Irish music using SMS shortcodes. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve used it, I&#8217;m in a permanent state of envy over how well it works.</p>
<p><a title="downloadmusic by conor" href="http://pix.ie/conor/685091"><img src="//photos4.pix.ie/A1/2B/A12B4B123DBA4ADF965619B0355100A3-500.jpg" alt="downloadmusic" width="500" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>From such a simple system, he has added value in so many places. The downloads now count in the Irish charts and have had a material effect on them on many occasions. The knock-on effect for small Irish bands is just enormous.</p>
<p>Because it is SMS based, bands can literally shout out short-codes on stage. Offline and online are now seamless! Not only that, but the site has been expanded to include band merchandise too.Â </p>
<p>The recent launch of a USB key featuring 15 of the best Indie tracks from DownloadMusic is another bit of marketing brilliance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.downloadmusic.ie/">Head on over</a>, play a few clips and try it out. If you like it, why not blog about it too?</p>
