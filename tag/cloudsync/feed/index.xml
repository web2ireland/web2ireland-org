A few months ago, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/niallsmart">Niall Smart</a> contacted us in relation to his new startup &#8211; and <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2008/11/07/new-web2ireland-startup-co-founder-wanted/">we did a post where he was looking</a> for a co-founder for his stealth startup &#8211; Cloudsync</p>
<p>Niall hooked up with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/488/178">Vinny Glennon</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/11/67a/b09">Cormac Driver</a> &#8211; and these guys were accepted to the world famous <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img src="//ycombinator.com/images/yc500.gif" alt="ycombinator" /></p>
<p>Cloudsync is now known as <a href="http://www.echodio.com/">Echodio</a> &#8211; and Niall pinged us over the weekend to let us know that they&#8217;ve been shortlisted by the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/accelerator/finalists">SXSW music+film+interactive festival</a> to present at SXSW Accelerator, their showcase for technology startups.  </p>
<p>One of four finalists in the music category &#8211; picked from over 200 applications.</p>
<p>Best of luck to the lads &#8211; keep the Irish flag flying&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hopefully this will be the first post on this meme&#8230; </p>
<p>Niall Smart contacted us in relation to his new startup &#8211; and he is seeking a technical co-founder to join the team.  </p>
<p><strong>Person Wanted</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re a talented developer, interested in working at the junction of digital music and cloud computing, and ready to play a key role in an early stage startup, then this is a fantastic opportunity:</p>
<p>    * Are you technically adept?  Our technology stack includes Ruby and AWS, but your track record is much more important than an exact skills portfolio.</p>
<p>    * Do you understand the importance of the User Experience?  This is a niche product for discerning consumers, and UX is a critical success factor.  You&#8217;re ready to play the game of inches.</p>
<p>    * Have you an entrepreneurial streak?  The right person will be enthusiastic, motivated, innovative and strategic, and comfortable with a degree of risk and uncertainty.   Essential traits &#8211;  along with a sense of adventure and fun.</p>
<p>================</p>
<p>To learn more, contact Niall Smart (niall AT cloudsync.fm) &#8211; and include a brief bio with your email.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
- Potential investment is currently under discussion with a small number of high calibre investors.<br />
- Based on investment &#8211; willingness to re-locate to Silicon Valley for 3 months</p>
