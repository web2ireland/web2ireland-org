				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/whatclinic-small.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1835" title="WhatClinic.com logo" src="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/whatclinic-small.png" alt="WhatClinic.com logo" width="600" height="84" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been around three years since we launched our website RevaHealth.com and during that time the most common response to hearing the name was &#8220;Aviva Health?&#8221; or &#8220;Vivas Health?&#8221; or some other brand name that rhymes with Reva. We knew we were onto a loser and that we&#8217;d have to change the name eventually, but we kept putting it off.</p>
<p>Finally, with traffic growing past the 500,000 per month point we decided we&#8217;d have to bite the bullet and after quite a lot of discussion we settled on <a title="health clinic search engine" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/">WhatClinic.com</a>. We figure it&#8217;s easy to remember, hard to mistake (the spelling) and it tells people exactly what the website is about &#8211; helping you to choose a clinic. Hopefully you agree.</p>
<p>As ever we&#8217;re trying to help people find clinics in their local area, like <a title="dublin dentists" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/dentists/ireland/county-dublin">dentists in Dublin</a>, and further afield, like <a title="cosmetic surgery turkey" href="http://www.whatclinic.com/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/turkey">cosmetic surgery clinics in Turkey</a>. Most of our traffic comes from the UK, Ireland and the US, but in the last month alone we&#8217;ve had visits from 193 countries or territories according to Google Analytics, another reason why the new, simpler name became so important.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve any thoughts about the new name or the service in general, or you&#8217;ve re-branded yourself recently, we&#8217;d love to hear about it in the comments.</p>
