<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.propelprogramme.ie/">The Propel Programme</a> is run by Enterprise Ireland and is designed to provide entrepreneurs with the necessary business skills to establish a successful global business. (Note that URL is not loading for me at the moment)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1108  aligncenter" title="propel" src="//www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/propel-300x70.jpg" alt="propel" width="300" height="70" /></p>
<p>Propel will run for one year and is open to those currently located, or planning to locate, in one of the six border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan or Sligo.</p>
<p>They will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial support of up to â‚¬30,000 (was â‚¬38k until recent cutbacks)</li>
<li>Business start-up training</li>
<li>Specialised expertise and mentoring</li>
<li>Access to potential investors</li>
<li>Access to local and global contacts and networks</li>
<li>Hot desk facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume Propel was modelled on the huge successes of Genesis, Hothouse, M50, EAC etc rather than being created from scratch by consultants.Â If you are in Munster, applications forÂ <a href="http://www.gep.ie/">Genesis</a> are still being accepted.</p>
<p>Final date for receipt of applications for Propel is 24 April 2009. Email startup@propelprogramme.ie or call (01) 605 9180</p>

<div class="entry"><p>LouderVoice is currently on the Genesis Enterprise Programme in the Rubicon Centre in CIT. I can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough. These schemes give people the opportunity to start a business with a support infrastructure around them. The advice and training alone are worth their weight in gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975" title="mwep" src="//www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mwep.jpg" alt="mwep" width="166" height="242" /></p>
<p>Brian O&#8217;Malley from EI in Sligo contacted us to tell us about the West and Midlands version of this programme:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Open Evening will take place in the Innovation in Business Centre(IiBC) at GMIT Castlebar on Wednesday 21st Jan from 5pm â€“ 8pm outlining the 2009 Midlands &amp; West Enterprise Programme (MWEP), commencing in March 2009, for people interested in starting their own business.</p>
<p>The one-year programme is a collaboration between GMIT and Athlone IT, and provides entrepreneurs with business skills, networks, facilities and supports necessary to navigate the business start-up process. It is delivered in GMITâ€™s campuses in Galway and Mayo, and in Athlone IT.</p>
<p>Applications are now being accepted.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in signing up for the course should ideally have a number of years industry experience and have the enthusiasm and drive necessary to develop and grow a successful business. The MWEP may also be of interest to expatriates who are hoping to return home to set up their own business in the West of Ireland. Participants may apply to Enterprise Ireland for CORD funding, which could provide up to 50 per cent of previous yearâ€™s gross salary.</p>
<p>The MWEP provides participants with business acumen, office desk space, mentoring, networking, facilities, and supports necessary to help them in establishing and running their own businesses. Participants should have a business idea with growth and export potential.</p>
<p>For further details, please contact Maria Staunton who is the business incubation manager at GMIT Castlebar on 094-9043198 or maria.staunton@gmit.ie</p></blockquote>

His post lacks any real substance and drowns in Minister-style knowledge economy buzzword bingo.</p>

<p>It kicked off a very long comment thread, most of which is unreadable, but which contains some real gems. The best of the lot is by Johnny Dunne who has a deep knowledge of the investment environment in Ireland.</p>
<p>Johnny does a brilliant analysis of how wrong-headed the â‚¬500m approach is in the short term, whilst accepting that long term it could provide benefit. It&#8217;s just a pity that those who are making these fundamental decisions are taking their advice from the foxes minding the hen-house who have already killed all the chickens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quoting it here with Johnny&#8217;s permission:</p>
<blockquote><p>The â‚¬500 â€œInnovation Fundâ€ is a great â€˜medium to long termâ€™ idea to help fund the development of businesses based in Ireland selling valuable good and services to international customers.</p>
<p>Our problems are a lot more urgent &#8211; we face a serious fall off in economic activity again in 2009. For example, Dell alone pulling out of Ireland with â‚¬10 bn+ / 10% of GDP gone in one go !</p>
<p>David, if the government can invest NPRF of â‚¬1.5 billion in â€˜cashâ€™ within â€˜one monthâ€™ in a bank with â€˜poorâ€™ assets and without a CEO and therefore you would have to assume NO business plan. I have never heard of a VC or a bank investing in a company without a Chairman, CEO and agreed plan !</p>
<p>Why not focus the â€˜special finance unitâ€™ in Anglo (and AIB,BOI) to invest say â‚¬500 million in growth companies without taking security as the government is not doing so! This unit which exist already invest in many â€˜largerâ€™ growth oriented companies some of them would be Enterprise Ireland clients. For example, the main criteria used for lending in Anglo are people, cashflows and asset quality. The government have guaranteed the liabilities and injected cash so the banks should lend to â€˜goodâ€™ people with a â€˜credibleâ€™ and (dare I say it) innovative business plans without recourse to personal guarantees and propert / assets backed security.</p>
<p>There needs to be urgent action with a â€˜fundâ€™ launched in January with say â‚¬500 million to invest in 2009 &#8211; why not? Anglo increased lending by â‚¬9 billion in 2008! A medium term plan to invest â‚¬500 million over many years is not enough. This money may not â€˜startâ€™ investing for at least another 12 to 18 months, even then if it is in the hands of US VCs it may provide little employment in Ireland &#8211; assume investee companies will need qualifying Irish operations ? If the local VCs like Delta, Atlantic bridge and NCB canâ€™t find opportunities with their strict â€˜VCâ€™ criteria, then the international VCs will find it harder unless we open the â€˜flood gatesâ€™ to fund earlier stage / developing companies.</p>
<p>There is a requirement (and suggestion) for many small funds say of â‚¬10 million each investing less than â‚¬1 million in a number of firms in order to open the â€˜pipeâ€™ of funded start-ups which can access further development capital at a later stage. Enterprise Irelandâ€™s policy with the latest round of â‚¬175 million of VC funds which 2 years after itâ€™s announcement has only allocated to 5 of the possible 8 funds. There is a â€˜believeâ€™ within Enterprise Ireland that small funds donâ€™t work as they donâ€™t have sufficient fund to follow their money. There has been calls for proposals from VCs, one in 2006 and another this year for the same money as the selected VCs couldnâ€™t seem to raise matching funds ? While over 20 funds applied on each occasion, only 8 were selected as 5 of these could only raise sufficient funds of at least â‚¬30 million inclusing state money. EI says this initial funding has leveraged â‚¬500 million for investment but already some of the more active funds like Delta and Atlantic Bridge have made multiple investments in non Irish companies. The reason ? based on their â€˜investmentâ€™ criteria not sufficient opportunities in Ireland ?</p>
<p>So why are the Government allocating Irish â€˜pensionâ€™ funds to US VC funds on a 50:50 basis now, when it could have done this many years ago when it was suggested before. Instead the â€˜mandarinsâ€™ in the NPRF and â€˜beancountersâ€™ in the Dept of Finance felt it was better to invest in international equities which we know where theyâ€™ve gone &#8211; south! US â€˜Tier 1? VC funds are well able to raise their own funds without state support 9this should apply where the market wonâ€™t go &#8211; remember there was 20 unsuccessful applicatns locally for the previous EI VC funding rounds). Why not just use the â€˜preferentialâ€™ tax to ensure they invest through and in Ireland not invest directly when they can access other sources of finance and need to be free to invest on an international basis. Local fund and banks can invest !</p>
<p>There is â‚¬400 billion of loans outstanding but AIB have contributed â‚¬15 with Enterprise Ireland to a â‚¬30 million seed fund and BOI have invested about â‚¬20 million in a â‚¬70 million fund which EI would have invested a similar amount. Recently Ulster invested a smaller amount with EI in the NCB fund. We are investing over â‚¬ 5 billion within 3 months in 3 banks with â€˜no securityâ€™ and a relatively small return up to 10% (VCs look for 30% and use preference shares all the time but ensure they can convert to control the business if management donâ€™t execute on the business plan). Why not pass the same terms through to ANY business certified by Enterprise Ireland or the IDA with a â€˜qualifyingâ€™ export oriented operation with the potential to generate more jobs and exports in the short term generating tax revenuesâ€¦.</p>
<p>The â€˜mind changeâ€™ needs to be within the Irish financial services sector to fund this â€˜Smart Economyâ€™ of the future.</p>
<p>Or should we just let â€œScience Foundation Ireland spend â‚¬7 billion on education and training in the years aheadâ€ with no medium term opportunity of generating sales !</p>
<p>There must be independent advisers with experience of investing or raising VC and banking funds better placed to advise the Minister rather than â€˜City folkâ€™ from Merrill Lynch generating massive fees to â€˜give awayâ€™ tax payers and pension funds money in return for no equity in the 2 major banks AIB and BOI which are obviously undervalued, as they donâ€™t seem to understand where the irish economy is and what it needs to survive over the next decade ???</p></blockquote>

<div class="entry"><p>I&#8217;ve heard nothing but good things about the <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/StartBusiness/EnterpriseSTART+Programme.htm">EnterpriseStart</a> programme in Cork. It was a real lifeline to many Motorola employees last year. The idea is to give basic business skills to those looking to set up their own companies.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Enterprise Start" src="//www.enterprise-ireland.com/NR/rdonlyres/60892AEB-941A-4337-AC42-115B5571031E/0/EIStartbanner.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="79" /></p>
<p>Mary Boyle let us know that they run the same scheme in Sligo and the next one is coming up. If you are even considering making the leap then it&#8217;s worth popping down to hear what it&#8217;s all about.</p>
<blockquote><p>A free information evening will take place in The Glasshouse Hotel, Sligo on 23rd September.  Hear from experts on the supports available to entrepreneurs and from companies who have already set up.  Liam Birkett will be the guest speaker on the night.  Liamâ€™s career began in office management in the grocery trade and extended into sales and marketing. He was involved in the launch of Mace and VG group in Ireland. His experience extended into wholesale, retail, cash &amp; carry, and consultancy on a national and international basis before moving to Oâ€™Kennedy Brindley Advertising (later to become Saatchi &amp; Saatchi).  With colleagues from the advertising agency, he founded Bernardini, Birkett &amp; Gardner Ltd, a design &amp; marketing consultancy which, for more than 20 years was responsible for corporate identities and many marketing initiatives for Stokes, Kennedy Crowley, Waterford Foods, Monaghan Co-op, Smurfit Group, The K Club, The new GAA branding as well as graphic and packaging projects for a long list of high profile clients.</p>
<p>The evening will kick off at 6pm.  For more information please contact Mary Boyle on 071 9159700 or mary.boyle@enterprise-ireland.com</p>
<p>UPDATE: The programme is happening in Cork too in October. Â ItÂ is delivered by a mix of trainers and entrepreneurs, over six weekends, and at the end of the programme participants file a short feasibility study. The participant is then given a mentor for 5 sessions. The total cost of the programme is â‚¬275, with the balance of costs funded by EI and FAS. Contact Paul DOT Healy AT cit DOT ie for details</p>
