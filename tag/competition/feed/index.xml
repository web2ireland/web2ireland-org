				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.startup2.eu/">Startup 2.0 Competition</a> has been around for a few years now and has always bubbled up some interesting companies that are not on the usual tech blog circuit. This year is all about Mobile and they are looking for the best Mobile Startups and Apps across Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.startup2.eu/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Startup 2.0" src="http://www.startup2.eu/wp-content/themes/startup2/images_content/logo_startup.png" alt="" width="175" height="75" /></a></p>
<p>The process is very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Submit <a href="http://www.startup2.eu/submit-project/">your entry here</a></li>
<li>An international jury and Internet users will vote for the best 5 mobile apps</li>
<li>On June, 17th the 5 best startups will present their projects at the <a href="http://www.nonickconference.com/nonick/">Nonick Conference</a> in Bilbao and people will vote to select the winner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disclosure: I&#8217;m one of the jury members.</p>
<p>There is so much happening in mobile in Ireland right now, it would be fantastic for those apps to get a wider audience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ruth Spencer from The <a href="http://www.ejc.net/">European Journalism Centre (EJC)</a> contacted me to let us know about The European Blogging Competition they are launching in Brussels from 25th to 27th of January coming.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="ThinkAboutIt" src="http://thinkaboutit.eu/press/banner_468x60.png" alt="" width="468" height="60" /></p>
<p>The theme is TH!NK ABOUT IT and the focus of the competition is the European Parliament Elections 2009. EJC wants to offer a platform for journalism students, aspiring journalists and bloggers to express their views on European topics as well as to report and cover the elections.</p>
<p>They want to have three bloggers from each country attending the launch event and will cover the travel costs. The timeline is:</p>
<p>Â </p>
<ul>
<li>Launch event: 25 January, 2009 &#8211; 27 January, 2009</li>
<li>Blogging: 1 February, 2009 &#8211; 9 June, 2009</li>
<li>Competition results: 12 June, 2009</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p>If this is of interest to you, read all the details and apply at <a href="http://www.thinkaboutit.eu/">www.thinkaboutit.eu</a></p>
<p>If you are wondering what this has to do with Web2Ireland, I&#8217;d simply say that the direction the EU takes over the next few years, particularly in how it deals with a global recession, will have direct impact on start-ups here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To complement our lovely new design we thought it might be cool to get a logo to go with it too. This wouldn&#8217;t just be for the site but also for events etc.</p>
<p>David Lenehan from <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a> came up with the very smart idea on Twitter of running a competition with prizes. Within minutes we had several offers for those prizes. So we&#8217;d like to announce the competition now.</p>
<p>The  rules are simple, just send us a sample of your logo(s) in one of the standard bitmap formats by Friday May 2nd to web2ireland DOT editor AT gmail DOT com. We will then publish a post showing them all and a poll allowing you to vote on them. The design with the most votes after one week wins!</p>
<p>The winner will not just get lots of publicity here and a permanent credit on the site but they will also win the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One year of PollDaddy Pro sponsored by <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a></li>
<li>A copy of Microsoft Expression Studio sponsored by <a href="http://www.microsoft.ie/">Microsoft Ireland</a></li>
<li>A year of Blacknight VPS hosting sponsored by <a href="http://www.blacknight.ie/">Blacknight Solutions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to David, Martha, Clare and Michele for the brilliant prizes!</p>
