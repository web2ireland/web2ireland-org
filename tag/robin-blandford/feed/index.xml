				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us were absolutely gutted when the <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a> finalists were announced and there was no sign of <a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">Decisions for Heroes</a> (D4H). Anyone who has been following what Robin Blandford has been doing with D4H knows what an amazing idea it is.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to 11850 It is a collaborative rescue team management tool to record and analyze rescue operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like the judges re-considered their decision. Perhaps they realised that the ideas around D4H can be re-used to build many highly valuable logistics-centered systems where the value is in the data.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="D4H" src="http://www.d4h.org/shared/images/random/5.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="279" /></p>
<p>In any case, that means we now now have an Irish entry in SeedCamp. Well done Robin! Hopefully we&#8217;ll have even more Irish finalists next year.</p>
<p>Given the energy and activity around incubation programmes like <a href="http://www.gep.ie/">Genesis</a> and EnterpriseStart, is it time to consider doing a SeedCamp-style programme here specifically for webapps?</p>
