				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thrilled to hear from Campbell Scott that <a href="http://www.IGOpeople.com/">IGOpeople</a> is in public beta starting today. They&#8217;ve been in stealth mode for a long time and we&#8217;ve all been looking forward to seeing it in action.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" title="igo" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/igo.jpg" alt="igo" width="614" height="418" /><br />
Campbell describes it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>a Network for the Real World that brings people together to Find, Connect and Converse, with their friends and with the businesses and organisations they deal with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounding like a very useful mix of Social Networking, discussion boards, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">GetSatisfaction</a> and <a href="http://uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, it looks like a great way for companies to see what people have to say about them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still rate Le Web 2007 as my conference highlight last year. A fantastic mix of people in a superb venue, I headed home full of excitement and ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s looking like <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/">2008</a> will be just as good and the lovely organisers have given us a discount for Web2Ireland readers. Just enter the code &#8220;BLOGDISCOUNT&#8221; on <a href="http://www.amiando.com/leweb08.html?discountCode=BLOGDISCOUNT">the registration page</a> to get 20% off the list price.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amiando.com/leweb08.html?discountCode=BLOGDISCOUNT"><img title="Registerleweb20disc" src="//www.leweb3.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/27/registerleweb20disc.jpg" border="0" alt="Registerleweb20disc" /></a></p>
<p>If you are trying to figure out your conference-attending budget for the next 12 months, I genuinely think Le Web should be a priority for you. Every major player in tech, media and finance across Europe and a lot of the US will be there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the type of conference where you can walk up to anyone, famous or not, and they&#8217;ll be happy to talk to you. You don&#8217;t have to send them your biz plan a month in advance and hope you are short-listed to get an audience with them. The networking opportunities are superb and the talks of very high quality.</p>
<p>I only wish there were more flights from Cork.</p>
