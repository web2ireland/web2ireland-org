				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lovely people down at <a href="http://www.wcdp.ie/">WCDP </a>(West Cork Development Partnership) in Clonakilty, have just announced an all-new Tech Conference called <a href="http://offsite.ie/">OFFSITE</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://offsite.ie/event-agenda/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2210" title="header-bg" src="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/header-bg.png" alt="" width="500" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really pleased they are doing this, and not just because I&#8217;m one of the speakers. There is a huge amount of tech activity happening in Munster but all of those companies rarely get a chance to meet and share ideas, knowledge or problems.</p>
<p>OFFSITE aims to get us all in the one place for a day and do exactly that. In addition to great speakers like Jerry Kennelly, John Dennehy, Donal Cahalane and Ger Keohane, they are also experimenting with a BarCamp session where anyone can offer to speak on anything in the tech sphere. Like all BarCamps, no self-pimpage will be allowed.</p>
<p>The other great aspect of the event is cost. Not €1900, not €900, it&#8217;s just €40 to cover those bits that WCDP isn&#8217;t allowed to sponsor. That includes lunch and coffee breaks.</p>
<p>Head on over and <a href="http://offsite2012.eventbrite.ie/">register</a>. It&#8217;s on Thursday 27 September in the Celtic Ross Hotel, Rosscarbery, just a few miles from Clonakilty.</p>
<p>I hope we see people from across the country attending. This could be the start of something special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
