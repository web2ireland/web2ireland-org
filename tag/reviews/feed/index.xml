				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Brennan has contacted us to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.ratemyarea.com/">RateMyArea</a>, a site dedicated to helping people find, review, share and discuss their favourite places. It&#8217;s a hyper-local social search site which currrently is concentrated on Dublin but they do have plans to expand their coverage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very attractive looking site with lots of information already in the system and an intuitive UI built around Google Maps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ratemyarea.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853" title="ratemyarea" src="//web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ratemyarea.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="245" /></a></span></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>This is a highly competitive area with startups like <a href="http://onthemap.ie/">OnTheMap</a> and large businesses like <a href="http://www.yourlocal.ie/">YourLocal</a> and <a href="http://www.goldenpages.ie/">GoldenPages</a> trying to get the critical mass required. The ones who nail it should do very well for themselves and shouldn&#8217;t require the massive spend of US businesses like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> to get scale. <a href="http://www.welovelocal.com/">WeLoveLocal</a> in the UK had a nice exit after barely a year and got most of their growth in London.</p>
