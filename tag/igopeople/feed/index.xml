				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was thrilled to hear from Campbell Scott that <a href="http://www.IGOpeople.com/">IGOpeople</a> is in public beta starting today. They&#8217;ve been in stealth mode for a long time and we&#8217;ve all been looking forward to seeing it in action.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" title="igo" src="//www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/igo.jpg" alt="igo" width="614" height="418" /><br />
Campbell describes it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>a Network for the Real World that brings people together to Find, Connect and Converse, with their friends and with the businesses and organisations they deal with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounding like a very useful mix of Social Networking, discussion boards, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">GetSatisfaction</a> and <a href="http://uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, it looks like a great way for companies to see what people have to say about them.</p>
