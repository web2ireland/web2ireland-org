				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thrilled to see all the coverage of <a href="http://www.skydeck.com/">Skydeck</a> recently. Their CEO is Jason Devitt who did Elec Eng in UCD just after me and who I could tell would do well even back then. I think at one point he was doing a Masters in Engineering and a Law Degree at the same time!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="//skydeck.com/css/images/free.png" alt="Skydeck" /></p>
<p>He showed amazing vision in building Vindigo in the late 90&#8242;s and I made use of their Palm Pilot City Guides many times. It&#8217;s only now that the technology has caught up with some of the things they were trying to do back then.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/jason_devitt_interview_skydeck.php">Read Write Web has a great piece</a> on him and what he is now trying to build with Skydeck. They are creating something very interesting indeed off the back of your mobile-phone bill and address book.Think intelligent mobile social network.</p>
<p>Just to get some sense of the guy, you have to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/skydeckvideo">this YouTube video</a>, seriously!</p>
