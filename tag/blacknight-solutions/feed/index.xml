				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To complement our lovely new design we thought it might be cool to get a logo to go with it too. This wouldn&#8217;t just be for the site but also for events etc.</p>
<p>David Lenehan from <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a> came up with the very smart idea on Twitter of running a competition with prizes. Within minutes we had several offers for those prizes. So we&#8217;d like to announce the competition now.</p>
<p>The  rules are simple, just send us a sample of your logo(s) in one of the standard bitmap formats by Friday May 2nd to web2ireland DOT editor AT gmail DOT com. We will then publish a post showing them all and a poll allowing you to vote on them. The design with the most votes after one week wins!</p>
<p>The winner will not just get lots of publicity here and a permanent credit on the site but they will also win the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One year of PollDaddy Pro sponsored by <a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">PollDaddy</a></li>
<li>A copy of Microsoft Expression Studio sponsored by <a href="http://www.microsoft.ie/">Microsoft Ireland</a></li>
<li>A year of Blacknight VPS hosting sponsored by <a href="http://www.blacknight.ie/">Blacknight Solutions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to David, Martha, Clare and Michele for the brilliant prizes!</p>
