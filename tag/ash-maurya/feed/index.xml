				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web2Ireland has a very big readership in the UK both from UK startups and also from an ever-growing number of Irish startups who have either moved there completely or keep a strong presence there, particularly in London.</p>
<p>So I thought that audience might be interested in a <a href="http://thousandseeds2.eventbrite.com/">Running Lean Workshop</a> that is being held in London on Wednesday. It is being run by <a href="http://www.ashmaurya.com/">Ash Maurya</a>, who is very well known for taking the quite academic and Enterprisey nature of much of the Lean material out there and turning it into a practical guide with more of a consumer web focus.</p>
<p>We have been using his book and one-page biz-plan methodology as part of the LaunchPad programme in <a href="http://www.ndrc.ie/">NDRC</a> and we&#8217;re big fans. We&#8217;ll be attending the workshop in Dublin.</p>
<p>So if you want to run your startup on Lean principles but want to get beyond principles, this should be perfect for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Â£149.00 for the day and that includes a copy of the book. <a href="http://thousandseeds2.eventbrite.com/">You need to register here</a>.</p>
<p>Venue is Main Lecture Theatre, University of Arts &#8211; London College of Communication, Elephant &#038; Castle, London SE1 6SB. </p>
<p>Wednesday 9th November from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
