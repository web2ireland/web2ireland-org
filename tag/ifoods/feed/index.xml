<p>It proves that great businesses with a world class team can still secure serious money. We&#8217;ve been fans of the iFoods concept since day one. They are going to be serious players in the food web-site niche. <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?id=1006846">eMarketer</a> did an article on this during the week.</p>
