<p>The team had the following thoughts on Seedcamp:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us were absolutely gutted when the <a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a> finalists were announced and there was no sign of <a href="http://www.decisionsforheroes.com/">Decisions for Heroes</a> (D4H). Anyone who has been following what Robin Blandford has been doing with D4H knows what an amazing idea it is.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to 11850 It is a collaborative rescue team management tool to record and analyze rescue operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like the judges re-considered their decision. Perhaps they realised that the ideas around D4H can be re-used to build many highly valuable logistics-centered systems where the value is in the data.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="D4H" src="http://www.d4h.org/shared/images/random/5.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="279" /></p>
<p>In any case, that means we now now have an Irish entry in SeedCamp. Well done Robin! Hopefully we&#8217;ll have even more Irish finalists next year.</p>
<p>Given the energy and activity around incubation programmes like <a href="http://www.gep.ie/">Genesis</a> and EnterpriseStart, is it time to consider doing a SeedCamp-style programme here specifically for webapps?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous post Conor wrote about <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2008/07/23/want-to-help-or-need-help-applying-to-seedcamp/">applying for Seedcamp</a>.Â  From the poll it seems a good number of people would like a little help filling out the application form (including myself) and some are available to lend a hand from their own experience of applying last year.</p>
<p>A room has been arranged in Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig, Cork for Thursday August 7th starting at around 9am.</p>
<p>It will be quite informal, the aim it to get practical advise from each other on answering some of the questions on the form to highlight your business or idea as best as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have print outs of the questions with me on the day. Anyone who&#8217;d like the them before hand, heres a link to the the <a href="http://seedcamp.com/Seedcamp-app_and_guidelines_2008.pdf">Seedcamp application PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.ewritecork.com/blog/2008/07/oriel-house-booked-for-seedcorn-application-brainstorming/">further information about the Oriel house location</a> over on my own blog.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gordon Murray of <a href="http://ewritelite.com/">eWrite</a> has come up with a brilliant suggestion for <a href="http://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a>. He thinks we should crowdsource some of the applications. Of course, this exercise will also help those who want to apply for <a href="http://www.seedcorncompetition.com/home.htm">SeedCorn</a> and other similar competitions.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who have experience in filling out application forms for the likes of Incubation Programmes, EI Grants, the SeedCorn competition etc. Why not use that expertise to help those applying to SeedCamp who may never have dealt with this sort of thing before?</p>
<p>So yet another call for interest. If there are sufficient numbers in Cork then Gordon will arrange a meeting room in the Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig for a morning. Those who want to apply and those who want to help can come together, figure out a strong message for each applicant and hopefully help them do better in the process.</p>
<p>If it works well, there is no reason this can&#8217;t be repeated in Dublin and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Usual story, fill out the poll (this one is for Cork only!) and ideally leave a comment or mail Gordon (gordon AT ewrite DOT ie) with some info about yourself. This is a very short term thing so the poll will close on Friday.</p>
