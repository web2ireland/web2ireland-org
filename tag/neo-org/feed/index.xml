				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Liao, serial entrepreneur, co-founder of <a href="http://www.xing.com/">Xing</a> and philantropist has just indicated that he wants to bring <a href="http://www.techstars.org/">TechStars</a> to Ireland!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/techstars.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1802" title="techstars" src="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/techstars.jpg" alt="" width="621" height="356" /></a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what TechStars is, in their own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get your startup funded and off the ground while learning from the best. Get up to $18,000 in seed funding for your new company, plus the chance to pitch to angel investors and venture capitalists at the end of the program. At the end of the three month program, it&#8217;s your company. TechStars is the best way to get your new company off and running and on a path to success. TechStars companies get 40+ educational opportunities during the program. Learn from over 50 highly accomplished mentors.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve only met Bill briefly and have his book Stone Soup on my desk waiting to be read. His energy and positivity is infectious. Given what he has achieved both in business and through his work in <a href="http://neo.org/">Neo</a>/<a href="http://weforest.com/">WeForest</a>, I have no doubt TechStars is going to happen and deliver results for the startup community here.</p>
