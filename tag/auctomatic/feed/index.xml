<p>Patrick hits the nail on the head in his observations about <a href="http://web2ireland.org/2009/04/01/announcing-web2ireland-e10m-seed-fund/">seed funding in Ireland</a></p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>Some extracts from article</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ireland has an abysmal record of encouraging technology companies, especially start-ups. This is masked by our stellar ability to attract companies for financial reasons. Though we have a few truly great companies, we have mostly failed to create a start-up community w</em>orthy of the name. (Quick â€“ try to think of an Irish technology company with revenues of more than, say, â‚¬50 million.)</p>
<p><em>And we might wonder: How could we possibly create a multitude of companies on the scale of Google, Yahoo, Sun, Facebook, Twitter and Cisco?</em></p>
<p><em>Paul Graham, a well-known Valley investor, suggested a would-be start-up hub should give $1 million to each of 50 start-ups, just to get them to relocate. $50 million is a tiny amount of money when weighed against the benefits it would bring (itâ€™s less than a quarter of the cost of the regeneration of Croke Park). And yet, such a move would, overnight, turn Ireland into one of the biggest start-up hubs in the world.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Assuming we got start-ups to relocate, many would need funding. Silicon Valley has a huge number of angel and venture capital investors. Though Ireland could probably eventually grow something comparable given enough time, some sort of bootstrapping is likely to be required.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Two final ideas. Though full of good people, Enterprise Ireland still take several months to make most investment decisions. This is crazy â€“ it encourages good companies to get their money elsewhere.<br />
</em></p>
