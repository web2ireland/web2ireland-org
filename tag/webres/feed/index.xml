<p>The company was valued at about â‚¬400 million in 2004 when it raised external funding from Summit Partners, a US venture capital company. However, it bought back some of Summit Partnersâ€™ shares in 2006 as part of a corporate restructuring.</p>

As part of that process, a total of â‚¬12.2 million was paid to trusts owned by Nolan, Kennedy and fellow director Paddy Holahan, and a further â‚¬1.5 million was paid to WRI directors and key management.</em></p>
