				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, the first <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland">BarCamp in Ireland</a> was held wayyyy back in September 2006 in Cork. It is still remembered as a wonderful day and I met many of the people I now know well for the first time there. Since that event in Webworks there have been further ones in Waterford, Dublin, Galway, Belfast, Kilkenny and Limerick.</p>
<p>Recently it was suggested to me that we have another one in Cork in January. I lobbed the idea out at an <a href="http://corkopencoffee.org/">OpenCoffee</a> to discover that there was tons of pent-up demand for a BarCamp and that January was too far away.</p>
<p>A further conversation with <a href="http://handelaar.org/">John Handelaar</a> at the hugely successful and very barcampy <a href="http://opencoffeeclub-bbq.com/">OpenCoffeeClub BBQ</a> got me all jizzed up about having one sooner too.</p>
<p>The next BarCamp is <a href="http://www.podcampireland.com/">PodCamp II</a> in Kilkenny on September 27th so I&#8217;d like to propose the next Cork one for the November timeframe. Sufficiently long after PodCamp but not too close to Christmas.</p>
<p>Please use the PollDaddy poll below to indicate levels of interest and, if it is there, I&#8217;m sure we can arrange something down here <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>UPDATE: I can&#8217;t see how to edit a poll after it is published but one great suggestion has been made, which is to offer &#8220;Any Saturday in November&#8221; as an option. If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d prefer, just enter it in &#8220;Other&#8221;</p>
