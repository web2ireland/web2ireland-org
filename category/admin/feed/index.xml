				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve just turned-on support for <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">Facebook Connect</a> on this blog. It enables you to comment here using your Facebook credentials and also to optionally send your comments from here to your Facebook profile.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961" title="Facebook Connect" src="//www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/connect.jpg" alt="Facebook Connect" width="264" height="409" /></p>
<p>To make use of it, simply login to Facebook using the Widget in the right-hand sidebar. Then when you comment on a post, you&#8217;ll be doing so as your Facebook identity.</p>
<p>Whilst we remain big fans of standards like OpenID, the simple fact remains that the implementations are non-intuitive, the plugins are flakey and the uptake has been tiny. Connect is instant portable identity for a much bigger demographic.Â </p>
<p>We were hugely impressed with <a href="http://davemorin.com/blog/">Dave Morin&#8217;s</a> presentation of Connect at <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/">Le Web</a>. I hope we can get him over to Ireland at some stage to tell us more. Any chance Ryan will get him over for <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/dublin/speakers">FOWA Dublin</a>?</p>
<p>Full instructions on enabling Facebook Connect on WordPress Blogs <a href="http://www.sociable.es/facebook-connect-wordpress-plugin-configuration/">are here</a>.</p>

<p>Since this was a clean install, I may have missed some bits from the old one. Let me know in the comments if you spot any niggles.</p>
