<div class="entry"><p>A quick bit of background&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="//media.linkedin.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/015/06a/25aed86.jpg" alt="Niall Smart" /><br />
A few months ago, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/niallsmart">Niall Smart</a> contacted us in relation to his new startup &#8211; and <a href="http://web2ireland.org/2008/11/07/new-web2ireland-startup-co-founder-wanted/">we did a post where he was looking</a> for a co-founder for his stealth startup &#8211; Cloudsync</p>
<p>Niall hooked up with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/488/178">Vinny Glennon</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/11/67a/b09">Cormac Driver</a> &#8211; and these guys were accepted to the world famous <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p><img src="//ycombinator.com/images/yc500.gif" alt="ycombinator" /></p>
<p>Cloudsync is now known as <a href="http://www.echodio.com/">Echodio</a> &#8211; and Niall pinged us over the weekend to let us know that they&#8217;ve been shortlisted by the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/accelerator/finalists">SXSW music+film+interactive festival</a> to present at SXSW Accelerator, their showcase for technology startups.  </p>
<p>One of four finalists in the music category &#8211; picked from over 200 applications.</p>
<p>Best of luck to the lads &#8211; keep the Irish flag flying&#8230;.</p>

<p>The guys at Dial2Do <a href="http://blog.dial2do.com/2009/02/13/dial2do-and-southwing-announce-revolutionary-hands-free-devices-for-drivers/">have announced</a> the Voice Assistant Service with Bluetooth headset manufacturer SouthWing, at MWC in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Drivers just push a button on their headset or carkit and speak to send text messages, send and listen to emails, record reminders and more. Powered by Dial2Do's Voice Platform, the service is a boost for anyone who wants to make best use of their time in the car, but stay safe and legal behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Dial2Do will be demonstrating the service at the Mobile Monday Peer Awards Barcelona, where they have been shortlisted in the Early Stage Startup category.</p>

<small>8th of <a href="/2009/02/">February 2009</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Last Wednesday saw the team from <a href="http://www.guidewiregroup.com/site/home.html">Guidewire</a> host a leg of <a href="http://www.innovate-events.com/">Innovate!Europe</a> in The Digital Exchange in Dublin. And what a day! Chris Shipley, Mike Sigal and Carla Thompson ran the most impressive start-up workshop I have ever encountered. If you missed it, you really missed out.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Innovate!Europe" src="//www.innovate-events.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/elements-of-seo/images/innovate-logo.png" alt="" width="187" height="55" /></p>
<p>The format was very simple. There were approx 12 Irish startups there including <a href="http://www.putplace.com/">PutPlace</a>, <a href="http://www.igopeople.com/">IGOpeople</a>, <a href="http://business.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a>, <a href="http://www.locle.com/">Locle</a>, <a href="http://www.toddle.com/">Toddle</a>. The day kicked off with each of us giving a 90 second elevator pitch. Then we gave our 10 minute company pitch and got feedback from the Guidewire team.</p>
<p>That feedback was accurate, fair, pointed and deeply useful. I gave the first company pitch of the day and everything I heard back from them was spot-on. During the rest of the day I was able to refine the deck quite a bit.</p>
<p>However, it was&#8217;t just the feedback on our own presentation that was valuable, it was hearing about the problems (and successes) in everyone else&#8217;s that made the day so special. As the afternoon progressed, we had more and more discussions involving everyone. This included some excellent insights from Ray Walsh in Enterprise Ireland.</p>
<p>One thing I did notice was the difference between the expectations of  Valley VCs  and Irish ones. I was told I could easily ditch my detailed financials slide in a Valley pitch. I was told the complete opposite as part of the Genesis programme.</p>
<p>The Innovate!Europe roadshow then moved to London on Friday. The remaining venues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>31 MARCH in Bern, Switzerland</li>
<li>3 APRIL in Berlin, Germany</li>
<li>6 APRIL in Paris, France</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a start-up based on the continent, you owe it to your business to attend one of these sessions. The best companies from the roadshow will then attend a Masterclass in Zaragosa Spain in May. The best of those will take part in a Trade Mission to the Valley in June.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Chris and the team for an invaluable day.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>Just picked up from Pat Phelan, founder and CEO of Maxroam&#8217;s blog on the news that <a href="http://patphelan.net/maxroam-partners-with-dopplr/">MAXroam has partnered with Dopplr</a></p>
<p><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/3228489705_550881c6d6.jpg?v=0" alt="maxroam on dopplr" /></p>
<p>Congratulations to Pat and team &#8211; and no doubt this is the first of many white label partnerships we will see from them in 2009</p>
<p>Press Release below&#8230;</p>
<p>Cubic Telecom partners with Dopplr to help travelers save thousands on roaming mobile user</p>
<p>MAXroam, the mobile roaming product from Cork-based Cubic Telecom, will be available in Dopplr&#8217;s online travel shop. Dopplr is an online service for smarter travel that helps the world&#8217;s most frequent travelers meet up with their trusted friends and colleagues around the globe. </p>
<p>Today Dopplr announced an online store with MAXroam as one of the key products. The store, which is available to all Dopplr travelers, contains a number of special offers on products and services to make travel better. </p>
<p>Speaking about the partnership, Cubic Telecom&#8217;s CEO Pat Phelan stated &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to be working with Dopplr. MaxRoam&#8217;s  SIM card will enable Dopplr travelers to save a minimum of 70% on their mobile travel bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within nine months of its launch in September 2007, MaxRoam had saved travelers more than $1 million on their roaming mobile bill and almost $1.7 million to date. These savings will now be extended to Dopplr members with a Dopplr SIM and website to manage their mobile usage while traveling.</p>
<p><strong>About Dopplr &#8211; www.dopplr.com</strong></p>
<p>Dopplr is an online service for smarter travel. Dopplr helps you make more of your travels by sharing your future trips privately with friends and colleagues. The service then highlights coincidences, for example, telling you that three people you know will be in Tokyo when you will be there too. You can use Dopplr on your personal computer or mobile phone. It links with many popular online calendars and social networks. </p>
<p><strong>About Cubic Telecom</strong></p>
<p>Cubic Telecom is one of the world&#8217;s first and largest suppliers of travel SIMs, which abolish high roaming fees that are usually charged by incumbent Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).</p>
<p>The company offers a 100% white label platform where MVNOs can customize everything as their own, including having their own branding of SIMs and web portal, plus customized audio prompts and short-codes.</p>
<p>MVNOs can set up multiple sub-distributors, each with their own discrete pricing, and customization, through Cubic&#8217;s innovative new offering.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>It looks like we&#8217;ll have the first two BizCamps in Ireland in very quick succession in March. These are unconferences in the style of BarCamp but focussed on business rather than tech.</p>
<p>Kicking off the day after FOWA, the first <a href="http://www.bizcamp.ie/">BizCamp</a> is in the Digital Hub in Dublin on March 7th. All details over on the site. Now if only I could decipher their tagline!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.stephenkinsella.net/2009/01/23/bizcamp-coming-to-limerick/">second one</a> is in the University of Limerick on March 21st. It is being held in the new Kemmy Business school, from 9.30am to 4pm.</p>
<p>In both cases, as with all *Camps, they only work if YOU make them work. So get on over and offer to help out.</p>
