<div class="entry"><p>The Irish Twittosphere growsÂ daily and has been attracting users far outside the initial cabal of geeks. The performance and scaling issues of earlier in the summer have been forgiven and generally the site has been stable. However in the past week much more serious problems haveÂ started happening.</p>
<p>We are getting multiple reports of users seeing gaps of of between 4 andÂ 12 hours in the updates from those they are following.Â Unlike the usual out-of-order messing that people seem to accept, these are black holes which are never re-filled. At the moment Iâ€™ve had no network updatesÂ for 4 hours and Iâ€™m in contact with two users who have had none for three days! The RSS feeds are similarly broken.</p>
<p>So far, Twitter has seemed resilient to user defection, I have to wonder how long that will continue. I would be quite happy to move completely to Jaiku if (and itâ€™s a big if) my network did too. Keep a close eye on all of those articles about social network portability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you too are frustrated with the silence on Twitter, you can find <a href="http://conoro.jaiku.com/">me</a>Â over on Jaiku where youâ€™ll also find <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/podcamp">several</a> <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/paddysvalley">Irish</a> <a href="http://jaiku.com/channel/irishopencoffee">specific</a> channels.</p>

<p>That really is the big if Conor and the reason I canâ€™t see why any social network should be in a rush to open up the social graph unless forced into a corner by the competition.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve run a niche sports website for 9 years which is mainly based around a discussion forum. You might call it a Social Network 0.5. What weâ€™ve learned in that time is that, as long as you donâ€™t completely drop the ball, a social network is amazingly resilient to mass migration. We know because weâ€™ve had several threats of mutiny after, regrettably, being forced to ban a few members along the way. Though a few of those threats gather a reasonably large amount of support none succeeded because none of our competing communities had anything like the number of members or volume of user generated content. To revive a cliche from Web 1.0 we really did have first mover advantage.</p>
<p>I too would be more than happy to leave Twitter for good in favour of Jaiku. But unless 50+% of my contacts do at the same time Iâ€™m unlikely to do so.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>The annual <a href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/">InterTradeIreland</a> all-island <a href="http://seedcorn.intertradeireland.com/index2.php">Seedcorn Competition</a> is heading towards its closing date of September 28th and the question many are asking is â€œshould we enter?â€. â‚¬100k for the winner is nothing to be sniffed at but does your web app stand a chance?</p>
<p>The competition started in 2003 and the winners to date have been Luxcel Biosciences, SmartHomes, Sigmoid Biosciences and EnBio. There is a very clear pattern here which seems to be putting off many in the web space from entering. Looking at the regional winners from the various years, there is a much wider spread of companies with several web ventures. However it does look like the scoring box marked â€œdefensible IPâ€ is highlighted in red given the types of businesses I checked.</p>
<p>Entering a competition like this is not a trivial decision since you are committing yourself to a lot of time and effort to go up against many more mature companies for a shot at â‚¬20k as a regional winner and then possibly the big prize. There is also â‚¬50k for the best emerging company.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m of the opinion that going through the process can be a great way of sanity-checking your business. If you donâ€™t have a good business plan, if your deck stinks, if you canâ€™t convince a panel of the value of your business, then Seedcorn will highlight this to you very quickly. Better to discover these problems in a competition than when you are trying and convince an Angel or VC to invest in your business.</p>
<p>I hope InterTrade avoids giving the 2007 prize to yet another Bio company. They also need to get more people on their evaluation panels who have a deep understanding of the web and content businesses. My experience in one of their master-classes was that this expertise was simply not in the panel I presented to.</p>
<p>Are you entering Seedcorn 2007? Have you considered it and decided against it? Have you entered in previous years? Weâ€™d love to hear about your experiences and why you made the decisions you did.</p>

<p>I entered it last year and came away with a â€œHighly Commended Awardâ€. Not sure if they give those to all entries <img src='http://ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
It took about a week to get my plan ready to enter and over all i found it worth while. They allow you to follow up after the competition to get feedback on your plan and where you can improve it.</p></p>

<small>29th of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Whilst Bebo is far and away the most popular social networking site in Ireland, it has always been a pretty mediocre site based on features compared to the competition. There is a PhD waiting for someone who figures out how it got the initial traction here. Of course, once it hit critical mass it became mandatory for kids of a certain age.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/joej/statuses/234481562">Joe Johnson just tweeted</a> that he saw an RSS icon in the blog feature and I had to check it out. And indeed they do. Of course there is still not even basic text formatting or HTML in the â€œblogâ€ but it looked like a start.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1266407466/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1262/1266407466_8c43acf1aa_o.png" class="block_center" alt="Bebo Blog Page" height="202" width="593" /></a></p>
<p>I clicked around a bit more and discovered that it is nowhere else (like photos etc) which was disappointing.<br />
Then I went back to the feed and clicked on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1266407202/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1234/1266407202_0e8ef14f36_o.png" class="block_center" alt="Bebo RSS Feed URL" height="82" width="539" /></a></p>
<p>Look at the URL. Notice the word â€œapiâ€? Are we seeing baby step one in a Bebo API? Are they going to beat MySpace to the punch? Are they looking at the success of the Facebook platform and realising this could be the thing to get them beyond bit-player status globally? Iâ€™ll be watching them a lot more closely from now on.</p>

<small>28th of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>The Nubiq guys in Waterford have been building applications for the mobile lifestyle for quite a while now. The <a href="http://www.mobiseer.com/">mobiseer</a> site (<a href="http://mobiseer.mobi/">mobiseer.mobi</a> from your phone) has just gone into public beta and is all about managing bookmarks of your favourite web-sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1258577238/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1440/1258577238_153dd490ec.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer Front Page" height="242" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The site enables you to organise, tag, share and manage your favourite .mobi websites either via the site itself or your phone. I use the comparison to Ma.gnolia rather than the more obvious del.icio.us simply because the feature set is more closely aligned, particularly with groups and ratings. The .mobi version of the site is very fast to load on my N70 which is a critical requirement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1258632496/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1116/1258632496_d87f1966c3_m.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer on N70" height="240" width="226" /></a></p>
<p>The core of the service is tagged bookmarking which alone is highly useful when optimised for a mobile device. The bookmarking features of Opera and Opera Mini on an N70 leave a lot to be desired. Whilst there are a few ways of accessing del.icio.us on a mobile device, they seem hacky. Ma.gnolia seems to have nothing for mobile and their design-heavy (and slow) site is probably not a good match for your phone.</p>
<p>As with any site like this, the first focus should be on the individualâ€™s needs and then on community. You can just use it as a personal store and ignore everything else. However the tag browsing, groups and ratings add useful social aspects to the site. In fact, given the slow uptake of the .mobi domain, this may be the best way of getting good mobile sites visible to a wider audience. The availability of RSS for most areas of the site is always key &#8211; I subscribe to tags of interest so that new bookmarks from users with similar tastes will bring me back to the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1257721699/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1382/1257721699_0f55b0a0cd.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Mobiseer Bookmark page" height="260" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the sites you bookmark do not have to be .mobi ones, but it would make sense that they are usable on a mobile (e.g. m.twitter.com). On that point, when I tried to load the .mobi on an N770, they obviously detected that I was not on a mobile and gave me the full site. However I was unable to logon. I actually use the â€œmâ€ versions of many sites on the N770 for speed reasons. If I request the mobi version of a site, I wish it would give me what I asked for.</p>
<p>I particularly like the â€œMy Mobileâ€ feature which allows you to drag n drop your favourite bookmarks into the order youâ€™d like to see them displayed by default when your phone connects to the site.  Something which might be nice for the future would be bookmark import from IE, FF, del.icio.us and ma.gnolia. They could even go one better and recommend mobile variations of bookmarks as they are imported.</p>
<p>Whilst the site is in beta, Iâ€™ve noticed no major problems. Most issues are just normal fine-tuning ones like â€œthis user has not added any bookmarksâ€ when this user = you. They should also add some filtering on the landing-page featured bookmarks to remove the naughty ones!</p>
<p>This is a genuinely useful site both for desktop and mobile use and I would strongly consider setting it as my browser home on both N70 and N770.</p>

<p>Hi Conor,<br />
 Thanks for the feedback and review. It is nice to finally be out there in BETA release. So keep the feedback coming <img src='http://ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>At present we do device detection upon access to either our .mobi or .com domains. While this is not always perfect, it does work most of the time. As we currently support a multiple of device formats (HTML, XHTML-MP, WML etc.) we attempt to detect the device and render as appropriate. As mobile devices are getting better and better all the time we default to HTML if we cannot detect the device.</p>
<p>You can add the following flag to the URL to bypass the detection routines and simply force XHTML for your N770. See the following link, this flag will work on both the .mobi and .com domains.</p>
<p>      <a href="http://www.mobiseer.mobi/?output=xhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobiseer.mobi/?output=xhtml</a></p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<small>27th of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Iâ€™m interested in getting some feedback on small business usage of <a href="http://www.google.com/a">GAFYD</a> (as I like to call Google Apps for Your Domain) in Ireland (and Europe generally). Until this year I was very dubious of Steve Gillmorâ€™s â€œOffice is deadâ€ mantra but as the year has progressed I have found myself using more and more online applications and fewer installed ones.</p>
<p>The standard Google Applications from GMail to Calendar and Docs/Spreadsheets are solid useful usable tools. It got to the point a few months back where I was happy to try out the free Google Apps for your domain. This entails some DNS changes on your side so that Google becomes the provider for your company email. You then get your own custom versions of GMail, GTalk, Calendar, Docs/Spreadsheets and a Personalised home page.</p>
<p>Initial impressions were good, particularly given that it is free but very quickly I found myself running into a variety of limitations and problems. It is quite clear that the â€œFor Your Domainâ€ development is done is total isolation from all the other online Google apps.</p>
<p>The single biggest limitation is that the login you are given for the Domain Applications does not work on any other Google application outside of the ones I have listed. In particular there is no Notebook, Google Groups or Google Reader. For a company so intent on being an integral part of every aspect of your online life, this just seems bizarre. There are a bunch of other problems like</p>
<ul>
<li>The Personalised Home page is very rough compared to iGoogle</li>
<li>The Calendar Widget on that page is totally broken</li>
<li>Many third party widgets do not work with that page</li>
<li>GTalk for your domain is completely flaky with third party applications like Pidgin</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall experience really is is less than slick. If I had a full SSO Google Apps experience, I would happily pay quite a lot per year for them taking all that administration effort off my hands.</p>
<p>What have your experiences been of Google Apps, GAFYD and the competition?</p>
<ul>
<li>Using and happy</li>
<li>Using but not happy</li>
<li>Used but reverted</li>
<li>Considering</li>
<li>Never heard of it</li>
</ul>
<p>I hear only good things about <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> and our limited usage of it so far has been positive. Any other recommendations?</p>

<p>Gmail, which Google Apps uses with a custom frontend, does not follow best practices. The source IP is not put into the email headers. This means that companies filtering mail end up filtering the Google SMTP completely or blocking certain netblocks when there is abuse. Itâ€™s been a topic of discussion on a lot of the anti-spam mailing lists over the last couple of years. </p>

<p>Michele &#8211; it did occur to me that the potential was there, but have there been actual instances of Google mishandling email?</p>

<p>Weâ€™re seeing quite a few people trying it out. Whether they will stay with it permanently or not remains to be seen.<br />
I can see the attraction of the apps, but I would be very concerned about Googleâ€™s (mis)handling of email.</p>

<p>I set this up last year for over 1,000 people and was happy with it.  When dealing with so many users, there were some problems with the bulk import (unable to assign aliases as part of the bulk import, for example), and really poor support from Google. </p>
<p>I was happy enough with the experience that I decided to use Google Apps for Your Domain for my companyâ€™s email this year.  I upgraded to Premier just because I had experienced the lack of support in the standard edition.  I agree that it is annoying that the login doesnâ€™t carry through to other Google services, and it is also annoying that very few of the external applications which have â€˜Gmail supportâ€™ have â€˜Google Mail for your domainâ€™ support, even though it is probably only a couple of lines of extra code.  I use iCal for calendar, and BaseCamp, but I keep coming back to Google Apps for collaboration on spreadsheets and word processor (BaseCampâ€™s Writeboards are very poor).</p>
<p>I had a quick look at Zoho and it seemed decent &#8211; will have to test it out some more though.</p>

<p>Using it and happy. Not crazy about the seperate SSO for the rest of Google, but its worth living with for the convenience of a maintainance free mail and calendar service.</p>
<p>We also use gtalk quite a bit and we have a start page with a bunch of useless widgets on it that I  blow hot and cold on.</p>

<p>We use it for similar reasons Conn. It also helps a lot when travelling. </p>
<p>I love the idea of GAFYD, it just feels like they need a Google SVP or EVP somewhere to crack a few heads together and get _all_ the apps working under Single Sign On.</p>
<p>I also like the Zoho freemium model and have heard they are getting lots of traction despite â€œnot being Googleâ€.</p>

<p>You and I have twittered before Conor, about the risks of my total reliance on Gmail. I feel happier about it now that Iâ€™ve backed it up locally with POP.  Iâ€™m not using GAFYD yet, but Iâ€™m increasingly building my operation around Google apps.  I passed my first scalability hurdle last week, setting up a second workstation in my office for occasional contributors.  Itâ€™s a PC running Ubuntu and it doesnâ€™t need Office &#8211; neither MS nor Open.  It doesnâ€™t need backing up either, or user configuration.  As my operation grows I can clone as many of them as I want.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s all about scalability.  At this critical stage in my business I donâ€™t have money for servers, backup systems or expensive software.  I certainly have no time to manage and maintain these systems.  Right now Google does that for me.  The challenge for them is to build a system which can grow with me, so that when I can afford to invest in my own infrastructure, I may not feel the need to.  If they can do that, then Office really is dead &#8211; and so too perhaps is Exchange, SQL Server, Oracle â€¦</p>

<p>I implemented Google Aps last February &#8211; At first, I thought I was going to use it a lot: Spreadsheets, docs, calendarsâ€¦ But I experienced the same hiccups you mentioned. I ended up using it as a mail service only (easy to add users and same benefits as gmail) and use Basecamp to manage the rest of our activity.</p>

<p>Excellent sticking the finger in where it hurts. Lotâ€™s of good question. Google is doing lots of clever stuff. But in the apps and office space they have made a start but it has quite a way to go still. Same with gdrive, where is it? Is Google stalling? Lacking a vision on a way forward? I wonder about that an awful lot lately</p></p>

<small>23rd of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Innovation by food related sites has always been lacking, possibly because most of them are built by experts in food rather than technology. So I was excited to hear at the start of the week about a new Irish site called <a href="http://ifoods.tv/">iFoods.tv</a> which launches today and promises quite a bit more than a discussion board and the odd recipe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1215503768/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1386/1215503768_38f1cccff8.jpg" class="block_center" alt="iFoods.tv" height="321" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The business is run by Chef Niall Harbison who started his career in some the most highly regarded and controversial restaurants in Ireland. He has spent the past few years working as a personal chef to a many celebrities so it is interesting to see him moving into this space.</p>
<p>First impressions are excellent with videos and recipes on the front page. They have designed the site to be utterly non-threatening to those who think Social Networks are for teenagers. If all you want to do is look for content and chat in the obligatory phpBB forums then this site will suit you fine.</p>
<p>In fact, I initially wondered if their press release tag line of â€œFacebook for Foodiesâ€ was accurate. But they have done the sensible thing for launch and placed all that functionality on your profile page. Sign-up asks a LOT of questions but many of them are light-hearted like star-sign, favourite ingredient, favourite TV chef etc. The profile page shows a lot of this and provides the key social networking features of friends and your wall (to steal an FB term).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1215502232/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1324/1215502232_811e6a1a4b.jpg" class="block_center" alt="iFoods.tv Profile Page" height="355" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Where I see big potential for the site is in the ability to upload your own video recipes and food photos. If your activity is visible to your friends as per the News Feed on FB, then I can see this becoming a real hang-out site for the ever growing foodie community in both Ireland and internationally. Their revenue model looks like mainly Freemium with partnering via competitions. However they do need to explain the benefits of the â€œGoldâ€ account better.</p>
<p>There are lots of feature they could (and probably will) add. Flickr/Photobox integration, YouTube/Kyte integration, RSS feeds, Events, aggregation of member blog posts etc but they have started with a very solid core and I expect it to take off quickly.</p>

<p>I have used Kyte for a while now and i see a great potential for â€œfoodies.â€  Kyte could prove to be a very powerful platform for chefs online since they could create shows once and instantly appear everywhere the channel is embedded. Kyte has tools that will allow chefs to post videos of them cooking as well as links to online recipes, etc. The possibilities are endless</p>

<p>Day late, dollar short.  Unless, of course, some GREAT features are released?  Alas, none of that on iFoods.tv.</p>
<p>Video-based cooking â€œsocial networkâ€ sites up long before iFoods.tv:</p>
<p>IPTVRecipes.com<br />
GroupRecipes.com<br />
iFood.tv</p>
<p>Plus others who have launched recently.</p>
<p>(Iâ€™m a chef/marketing geek and take an interest <img src='http://ie.blognation.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Of the above, IPTVRecipes.com and GroupRecipes.com get a big thumbs up, with IPTVRecipes.com getting 2 thumbs up for their recent â€œbeat YouTubeâ€ feature of allowis us cooks and chefs to upload multiple files for 1 recipe (their system â€œsewsâ€ all video files together, for those of us who use Digital Cameras and Videos Phones [stop and go makes multiple videos]) and allowing up to 1Gb of space *per recipe* (allowing cooks to educate their audience, and walk you through the process, like TV cooking shows).  Theyâ€™re ahead of these other sites in what â€œweâ€ need.</p>
<p>Someone asked about iFood.tv versus iFoods.tv and whether it was a network, this is the kicker, LOL.  The answer is no, they are not a network.  iFoods.tv are 2 chefs in Ireland while iFood.tv was made by a couple of techies from India.  The kicker? iFood.tv didnâ€™t buy the domain iFoods.tv when they bought their domain/opened for business &#8211; .  Lord, InternetBusiness101 gang, if a â€œlikeâ€ domain exists which people can easily (and mistakingly) type in their browser exists AND itâ€™s available to purchase, BUY IT.  On the flip side, iFoods.tv came in the market 1.5 years after iFood.tv so they reap the benefit of typos from people going to iFood.tv.  But, if they do well, reverse the scenario.</p>

<p>Although I havenâ€™t signed up to become an iFoods TV member, I just went through half a dozen of their smart, upbeat and no non-sense food preparation videos.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m feeling much more confident about preparing the next few meals for my wife and kids. Iâ€™ll probably spend more â€œquality timeâ€ in the kitchen too!</p>

<div class="author">
<img src="/wp-content/themes/default/w2i/authors/3.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="conor" title="conor" />
<small>22nd of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Itâ€™s only a slight exaggeration to say this considering the number of events that are happening around the country next month. The variety is just as important as the count with some which are entirely new to us. The anchor will be <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2007/08/17/web2ireland-week-september-10th-to-14th/">Web2Ireland Week</a> from 10th to 14th in Dublin. Iâ€™m really buzzing about this and weâ€™re thrilled to announce that blognation is a media partner.</p>
<p>The week kicks off with the very highly regarded <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a> and University in TCD. This is the fifth to be held worldwide and is run by <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind">David Berlind</a> and Doug Gould.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1201824669/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1221/1201824669_41f12a2d8e.jpg" class="block_center" alt="MashupCamp 5" height="107" width="500" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p> This is an unconference-style event thatâ€™s dedicated to bringing together the Internet software mashup community for a face-to-face collaborative meetup where new relationships are formed, old relationships are nurtured, ideas are shared, multiple balls are moved forward, and innovation happens in real-time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the concept of a Mashup;</p>
<blockquote><p> Mashups are most often characterized by the way they draw upon functionality and/or content from two or more sources to produce a new creative work. For example, if a birdwatcher â€œmashed upâ€ her own database of birdsightings (by GPS coordinates) with the functionality and content of Google Maps, the resulting visual presentation where the locations of birdsightings are interactively overlayed on top of a map could be considered a mashup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are starting with Mashup University which is specifically geared towards hands-on training whereby new and experienced mashup developers can get classroom style instruction on how to build mashups using the technologies from API providers and mashup enablers.</p>
<p>This is followed by Mashup Camp itself where the attendees define the agenda by discussing ideas for mashups. People network, contribute, and rub shoulders with each other. The Camp is also a great place for the various mashup API and technology providers to meet face-to-face with developers. Some of the suggestions for this Camp include â€œMobile UI development and iPhone optimizationsâ€ and â€œMashup Adoption Issues Across the Enterpriseâ€.</p>
<p>It really looks like a superb opportunity for the Irish web development community to meet and come up with interesting ways of working on things together. Attendance is a paltry â‚¬25 for developers.</p>
<p>If you are attending MashupCamp, the <a href="http://rubyireland.com/2007/8/21/september-2007">RubyIreland</a> folks have extended an open invitation to you to attend their regular meetup from 7pm-9pm on Tuesday 11th in the Morrison hotel. They retire to La Taverna Di Bacco in the Italian Quarter next door afterwards. Itâ€™s always a very sociable and entertaining night. Also keep an eye out for a <a href="http://dublincodejam.pbwiki.com/">CodeJam</a> they are planning. It may happen in September too.</p>
<p>On Thursday the 13th we have several events happening. The first is a meetup of the <a href="http://paddysvalley.org/">Paddyâ€™s Valley</a> attendees at 5pm in Ely HQ. This is a trip being organised to Silicon Valley by a bunch of Irish start-ups to raise their profiles, meet with their peers and idols and do a few elevator pitches. There are currently over 25 people signed up to travel from Dec 2nd-9th. The meet-up is a way of getting to know each other, discuss the itinerary, address concerns, swap Valley contacts and hopefully attract even more attendees. If you are undecided about going this is one way to find out more.</p>
<p>Immediately following this in the same location is the combined <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2007/08/21/web2ireland-demobar-fowa-roadtrip-web2ireland-week/">DemoBar</a> and <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/">FOWA Road Trip</a>. This is starting to look like one of those evenings where, if you donâ€™t turn up, youâ€™ll be kicking yourself for months after.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1202690884/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1202690884_f24b3990b2.jpg" class="block_center" alt="FOWA" height="200" width="296" /></a></p>
<p>DemoBar is an opportunity for 10 web start-ups to demo their wares to the assembled crowd in, yes youâ€™ve guessed it, a bar. This crowd will consist of your peers, Irish and UK investors, the press and government agencies. Those who nail it will be helping their businesses (or nascent businesses) hugely. Details for signing up are over on the <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/">Web2Ireland</a> site and it is sponsored by Microsoft.</p>
<p>FOWA  Road Trip dovetails beautifully into this. Ryan Carson and the crew are travelling around Europe, meeting with like-minded web professionals and other people in the web app industry. The <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">FOWA conference</a> itself is always packed with industry players and Road Trip is just one of those fun nights where you can talk shop, network and maybe bend Ryanâ€™s ear a bit.</p>
<p>If you still have energy left after those four days, then head on over to the Morrison hotel on the Friday morning for OpenCoffee Dublin. Itâ€™ll be a useful way of winding down, talking about the week and maybe help with planning what comes next which isâ€¦</p>

<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampGalway">BarCamp Galway</a> on September 22nd. We really have taken BarCamp to our hearts here. It kicked off in Cork last September and was followed by Waterford, Dublin and Belfast. The guys is DERI are hosting this one and there are already 55 people signed up. Given some of the very cool research the DERI guys do and the buzz behind SIOC, I think you can expect some really special presentations. This is followed a week later byâ€¦</p>

<p><a href="http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/PodCampIreland">PodCamp</a> on September 29th in Kilkenny. This is the first unconference dedicated to podcasting to be held in Ireland. All of the leading practitioners will be attending and there is a real sense of evangelism about the event. I fully expect to see a burst of new podcasters after this.</p>
<p>If Iâ€™ve missed out on anything else happening in September, let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I got an email this morning about Mashup Camp being postponed. </p>
<p>They did not have enough signups, which is not surprising given the total lack of engagement with the Irish blogging and development communities. </p>
<p>Given sufficent time and energy into organising it, the re-scheduled one will be a big success. </p>
<p>David and Doug were brutally honest in their email to those who had signed up and that will stand to them in the coming months.</p>

<small>20th of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.zimbie.com/">Zimbie</a> comes from research carried out by the <a href="http://www.tssg.org/">TSSG</a> (Telecommunications Software &#038; Systems) Group in Waterford Institute of Technology. TSSG is a hotbed of research commercialisation and Iâ€™m always interested to see what they are doing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1185525969/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1274/1185525969_d9b030c15d.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Zimbie Homepage" height="374" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The first question you ask with any new product or service is â€œwhat does it do?â€. When I first encountered Zimbie via an email from Sean Lyons and looked at their site, I wasnâ€™t really able to tell. It appeared to have something to do with alerts, IM, RSS and blogging. Once I talked to Sean about it, I understood it and liked a lot of what he had to say. Zimbie is about delivering time-sensitive information via IM. The first implementation is focused on RSS and they are using blogs as an example.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I went to try it out and got a few surprises. The first is that it is not a web-service at all but PC software you install. First you start with their Jabber-compatible IM client and then you add the RSS â€œpluginâ€. You configure that with the RSS feed you want to deliver to people. Then you logon to GTalk and others can add that GTalk user as a friend and start getting RSS notifications from your â€œbotâ€ via IM. Phew. I had to read a 15 page Word Doc and watch a video before I got it working!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1186382090/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1242/1186382090_188ec950ea_m.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Zimbie IM Client" height="240" width="188" /></a></p>
<p>I can think of lots of great uses for RSS-to-IM, but new blogpost notifications is not one of them. A trivial example might be something like the sadly neglected <a href="http://corkprobs.info/">corkprobs.info</a> site I created which allows Twitter users to report gas/water/road problems in County Cork. You tweet that there is a crash on the N8, Zimbie monitors the RSS feed and delivers that message via IM to anyone who is subscribed so they can find an alternative route home.</p>
<p>I worked in enterprise software for several years and I always felt there must be a simpler way of doing what the woefully misnamed SNMP did in many scenarios. Build RSS into monitoring software like Nagios and Zimbie could deliver filtered notifications to multiple sysadmins with nothing more installed at the receiving end than an IM client. The other examples on the Zimbie site make sense too: latest news/sport/business feeds, changes in stock markets and updates on car or property sites. I would have killed for a service like it during the recent election.</p>
<p>However I have doubts that the current implementation is going to get much traction amongst early adopters. Many of us have MSN, Yahoo and GTalk Messengers installed but disabled and which we have replaced with GAIM/Pidgin, Miranda, Trillian or Adium. The thought of installing another client (all 28 Megs of it) particularly another Jabber one will be a deal breaker for many. I think that creating Bots as plug-ins for GAIM/Pidgin would garner a lot more interest and give immediate cross-platform capability.</p>
<p>A client-based install makes sense in an enterprise environment but in consumer web I have to wonder if a web-service like <a href="http://feedcrier.com/">Feedcrier</a> would suit a lot more users? Is a hybrid approach possible?</p>
<p>I would love to see all those notification and update programs that seem to be included by every recent software install replaced with a subscription to the relevant RSS feed. This would be via feed reader for low-priority things like JRE updates and via Zimbie for important updates like security fixes.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m going to continue watching Zimbie closely as it is early days for them and there are lots of directions they can take based on the same core technology. Even within RSS there is so much happening in the semi-real-time notification area that they have myriad opportunities for exploiting niches.</p>

<p>Well boy!</p>
<p>I use phpBB on the <a href="http://www.upthedeise.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.upthedeise.com</a> forums and installed the RSS2 plugin which basically allows you to view the forum as an RSS feed.</p>
<p>I then installed Zimbie to run an IM service that watches the boardâ€¦ I used the IMPRESS plugin which meant I didnâ€™t have to write a line of code!</p>
<p>Now anyone can add the <a href="mailto:upthedeise.butty@gmail.com">upthedeise.butty@gmail.com</a> to their buddy list and be notfied of new threads on the boardâ€¦ could be very handy for people wanting to seed message board forums etc.</p>
<p>Zimbie has a lot of potentialâ€¦ looking forward to MSN support in particular!</p>

<p>Yes, we have started our next development phase where we plan to add support for the other main IM protocols, (MSNP, AOL, Yahoo). We also intend to create an enterprise version of Zimbie where the application runs in server mode managing multiple bots in a scalable fashion. We can currently run in a non-UI mode but we have yet to add an admin interface to this.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Kieran.</p>

<p>These are exactly the kinds of niches I was hoping to hear about. </p>
<p>I think the blogging example actually under-sells what Zimbie can do. </p>
<p>Are there any plans to run it as a windows service so that the bots can run un-logged-in and unattended on a server or a VM?</p>
</p>

<p>Hi Conor, </p>
<p>Thanks for the mention. I would just like to add that the rss service to bloggers is really just an example of the type of IM service that can be created using Zimbie. The application is essentially designed for developers to quickly create IM services using the framework provided. Services can be created from simple auto-responses to fully developed applications, for instance we are supporting projects here with Waterford City Council where they have a buddy interacting with the Regional library database for end users to query over IM. Also a partner in Germany (PSI) has integrated Zimbie with a flood warning system to notify operatives over IM.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Kieran.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>In the launch story on Monday I said that I expected to see more and more combined Web/Mobile applications appearing in Ireland. On Wednesday I talked to Johnny Beirne of <a href="http://downloadmusic.ie/">DownloadMusic.ie</a> and got a valuable lesson in Long Tail businesses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1150305598/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1150305598_82060f21bc.jpg" class="block_center" alt="DownloadMusic.ie" height="319" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>On the surface this is a simple online music store built on a standard osCommerce platform. Johnny launched it nearly a year ago with a mission to bring independent and unsigned Irish acts to a much wider audience. In the initial months sales were light and he focused on building the relationships to artists. Then earlier this year he added the ability to buy songs via SMS and the site took off at an amazing rate.</p>
<p>This simple feature hides a lot of depth and understanding of people and demographics. Quite simply, the average indy music fan is probably a teenager or young adult who may not even have a credit card. Enabling them to buy tracks via SMS lowers the barrier to entry enormously. Even for those with a credit card, sending a simple SMS is even easier than using PayPal.</p>
<p>However it even goes beyong that. Johnny is a music fanatic and attends many gigs at which his client bands are playing. In many cases the bands hand out flyers with the SMS codes for their songs printed. In some cases they are even calling them out from the stage! As Johnny says â€œthis is real social networkingâ€. At Cork OpenCoffee this morning we discussed the fact that none of the interesting mobile applications are coming from the operators. Johnny has some clever ideas for leveraging user interests/purchasing on his site with the real world networking at gigs via the ultimate social device, the mobile phone.</p>
<p>As DownloadMusic is fully registered with IRMA, each download counts towards the charts and their sales have enabled 10 Irish bands to get well into the charts. He gave a recent example of a band that had 177 downloads in one week on his site but only 10 on iTunes. This brings up an important aspect of the Long Tail. Just because a mega-site like iTunes has your songs doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll get any more than one or two downloads. Because DownloadMusic focuses on a very specific niche they can highlight bands and drive downloads.</p>
<p>They have also partnered with Eircom, the main telco here, to provide music to their users and have an Eircom branded Flash music player. It will be interesting to see if they start extending out into MySpace or the Irish obsession, Bebo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1149461369/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1071/1149461369_b7630fa016.jpg" class="block_center" alt="DownloadMusic Eircom Player" height="294" width="247" /></a></p>
<p>Many think that Web2.0 is about technology and Ajax and tagging. I donâ€™t believe this at all, itâ€™s about people and enabling them to do interesting, useful and fun things together that they couldnâ€™t previously. DownloadMusic.ie understands this innately and their passion for making independent music more accessible can easily translate to a wider European audience.</p>

<p><b>Comment posted by Ken McGuire</b><br />at 8/18/2007 4:08:40 PM
<p>Working on the ground level with unsigned Irish bands (outside of the 9-5) Iâ€™ve got to say Iâ€™m impressed with the way DownloadMusic.ie is operating and assisting unsigned acts in the country.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the bands wonâ€™t make a fortune from the sales generated from the site but it is putting their tracks into the hands of fans immediately and the connection with IRMA is perfect. It combines the best of freely and readily available technologies to boost a bandâ€™s profile and reputation, something of a revolution for the Irish music scene.</p>
<p>Have hosted some of the bands in the eircom flash player above (most recently The Aftermath with their new single available on Downloadmusic.ie) Iâ€™ve been able to chat to the bands about their participation with DM.ie and Iâ€™ve yet to hear a bad word. It has become a simple and cost-effective way for a band to introduce their music to main stream media heads and as you pointed out, theyâ€™re charting as a result.</p>
<p>Long may the growth of it continue.</p></p>
