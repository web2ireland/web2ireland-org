<div class="entry"><p>Werner Vogels, Amazonâ€™s CTO, announced  the Euro S3 storage cloud at Web2Expo on Tuesday. An informed source has just let us know that the cloud will be served from their Dublin datacenters. This is the second major coup in this area for Dublin in a week.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/11/amazon_s3_in_europe.html">Vogels</a> said on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has been a frequently requested feature by our European customers for various reasons, better latency control being the most important one. This is very important first step as it brings Amazon Web Services closer to the world-wide application development platform our customers want it to be. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done to make the services the absolutely best tools for international internet-scale application development, but the ability to control where you store your objects is an important first step.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>ICT Irelandâ€™s <a href="http://www.enn.ie/article/10123381.html">latest report claims</a> that Ireland is still a very attractive location for technology multi-nationals. I wouldnâ€™t expect them to say anything else but how true is it?</p>
<p>Large corporations go where the ROI is highest and thatâ€™s it. The good old days of Irish-American VPs and Paddies sealing deals on golf courses are long gone. Whichever country offers the cheapest labour that is capable of doing the job and provides the best tax breaks, gets the gig.</p>
<p>On the upside, there are plenty of positive signs;  Googleâ€™s expansion in Ireland is given as the strongest evidence that all is well. Intel, HP and IBM still have huge operations here and they are generally at worst static and in some cases growing. However the obstacles are getting greater with each passing month; salaries are high, software development is now commoditized, transport infrastructure is a joke and, most important of all, there is a dearth of qualified people available to hire.</p>
<p>You would expect that a start-up like LouderVoice would do all its work locally but we had to offshore all of our work after severe difficulties in finding anyone to do it and then getting an Irish quote which was 4x the non-Irish one we went with. I know of several other Irish start-ups who have teams in Poland.</p>
<p>There are even several Indo-Irish companies where project management happens in Ireland and the coding is done in India. In fact there are many multinationals here where the Irish â€œsoftware development teamâ€ are now just PMs for Indian teams. How long before the PM jobs go there too?</p>
<p>On the surface, <a href="http://apnews.excite.com/article/20071106/D8SOAJK80.html">Microsoftâ€™s announcement</a> of a $500m datacenter in Dublin is another vote of confidence. But then you see that only 15 people will be employed there. The datacenter has more to do with the enormous fibre pipes that were built during the bubble and tax breaks than the â€œknowledge economyâ€.</p>
<p>As long as times are good, the multinationals will probably continue to come here, but as soon as the squeeze happens, either to the global economy or to individual corporations, theyâ€™ll be gone as quickly as you can say SFO-BLR. We need to concentrate instead on building great Irish companies that compete globally. Our reliance on multinationals continues to foster an employee mind-set rather than an entrepreneurial one. The cycle must be broken.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>There is a great run-down on the venture deals completed in Q3 over on <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1011730.shtml">Finfacts</a>. The total investment was up and nearly hit â‚¬30m but the number of deals was at five. Yes international readers, you read that right, not five deals per VC, five deals in the entire country.</p>
<p>We know we are far behind the UK and the US in terms of maturity in this area but five deals is just embarassing. How many were done in Israel in the same period? Should Enterprise Ireland be re-evaluating their â‚¬170m bank-rolling of the VCs here particularly when one of them used that leverage to build a fund which invested in a UK company first?</p>
<p>It looks like most early stage tech companies here will have to rely on the revamped Business Expansion Scheme to raise capital. This is a scheme which allows investors to get almost half of their investment back via tax refunds. This type of investment is often called â€œdumb moneyâ€ by the more â€œsophisticatedâ€ investors but my gut tells me that if Ireland creates the next Facebook, it will be backed by the so-called dumbos.</p>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1903570039/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/1903570039_f29de75702_o.png" class="float_left" alt="3gdoctor01.png" height="115" width="187" /></a> There is finally a practical use for the front facing camera on your 3G phone and it comes in the shape of remote medical consultations courtesy of the Kerry-based <a href="http://www.3gdoctor.com/">3G Doctor</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile telcos have never been able to live up to their own hyperbole when they paid billions for their 3G licences. Apart from faster data connections for mobile warriors, the services have taken forever to trickle out. This one has the potential to be huge and Ireland is the perfect place to launch from.</p>
<p>Getting medical attention in Ireland is becoming more and more of a strain. From queuing for hours at GP clinics â€œjust in caseâ€ to out-of-hours services that only work if you live in big towns, we need something to reduce pressure on the system. Here in Cork if you need out-of-hours help you call SouthDoc and a nurse triages you over the phone. They err well on the side of caution and seem to always tell you to come into the clinic. The problem is that phrases like â€œbleeding profuselyâ€ are far too subjective.</p>
<p>Imagine then that you arrange a call to the 3G doctor on your phone. They can actually see your complaint and can decide if [a] you are fine, use a band-aid [b] you need to go to a clinic for some stitches or [c] you are bleeding to death, call an ambulance. This remote view of symptoms is far more efficient and is a major help to those who live rurally. It is also a full diagnosis rather than the basic Q&#038;A that e.g. the VHI or NHS helplines provide.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1903569811/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2079/1903569811_c6519805b5_o.png" class="block_center" alt="3gdoctor02.png" height="242" width="188" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously they cannot do prescriptions but I cannot wait for the day when this is possible. In years to come, we will hopefully see a range of home diagnostic equipment which would allow doctors to say for sure that you have a bacterial chest infection, please go to the pharmacy and get Augmentin-Duo. Companies like BiancaMed with their non-invasive health analysis systems are sure to be at the forefront of that if it does happen.</p>
<p>This is one of those service that just clicks with me, it just makes complete sense. Both the HSE here and NHS in the UK should be actively working with and supporting these guys to make this service accessible and known to as big an audience as possible.  It really is a win-win for doctors and patients.</p>
<p>Of course it could be extended to deal with a particular annoyance of mine &#8211; OAPs filling up GPs waiting rooms every day with non-complaints. Could a service be created that leverages retired doctors to deal with these OAPs? It would be another pressure-reducer on our creaking health systems.</p>
<p>One area I discussed with David Doherty from 3G Doctor was Microsoftâ€™s HealthVault. I wondered if their own  Health Record was in competition to it? His answer impressed me</p>
<blockquote><p>HealthVault is one of the more open health record solutions and as with all the others weâ€™ll be doing our utmost to work with it. However at 3G Doctor we provide patient tools and this is more of a health care provider tool. We find it hard to see the mass market appeal of a stand alone health care record for consumers because patients find it hard/impossible to appreciate the value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The average patient is several years away from being comfortable with the idea of HealthVault but I think they are more than ready for a service like 3G Doctor.</p>

<p>Thanks for all that great extra information Fiona. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve suggested your service to a few people who had conditions that could easily have been figured out over 3G rather than forcing them out in the cold to visit SouthDoc!</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by Dr Kavanagh</b><br />at 11/29/2007 8:32:22 AM
<p>Hi Conor,</p>
<p>Thanks for your enthusiasm for 3G Doctor â€“ Iâ€™m sorry to hear of your disappointment with waiting room times.</p>
<p>Clearly 3G Doctor is all about taking the wait out of getting professional advice but Iâ€™d have to slightly disagree with you on the burden you suggest that OAPs with â€œnon-complaintsâ€ have on our healthcare system. Not only have their contributions paid for the building of the healthcare systems that we have today but their use of the services are unavoidable and limited. In fact, statistics show the vast majority of care costs are currently spent on chronic care conditions and although many older people suffer with these, many are preventable and are determined at a much earlier age â€“ resulting in more expensive and much longer overall care requirements.</p>
<p>Although we would be delighted if older people felt comfortable using 3G Doctor to avoid having to travel in the cold weather to attend a clinic for some minor advice or guidance, we feel that even more value could be generated by using early and interventional care initiatives that could help younger people avoid and prevent against the development of major chronic conditions. At 3G Doctor we have made available a tool that enables the creation, management and storage of a personal health record and health diary. All this requires patients to have is a 3G mobile phone (no wires, PC, Monitor, webcam, mouse, keyboard here!) and they can begin to take control of their own health information safe in the knowledge that they have the advice and support of our health professionals on hand at anytime.</p>
<p>Because 3G Doctor brings patients closer to healthcare professionals with greater levels of convenience and privacy it is in an unique position to help prevent against the onset of many chronic diseases which asides from cost are also associated with many other quality of life issues for patients as well as friends, family and carers. This is particularly important for conditions which have significant lifestyle or social elements to them eg. obesity &#038; related disease, smoking, alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, etc.</p>
<p>If any readers would like to learn more about this Iâ€™d suggest a recent (FREE) report by the Californian Health Foundation which can be downloaded from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chcf.org/documents/chronicdisease/HealthCareUnpluggedTheRoleOfWireless.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.chcf.org/documents/chronicdisease/HealthCareUnpluggedTheRoleOfWireless.pdf</a></p>
<p>As for your comment on the possibility for cooperation with the NHS and VHi â€“ youâ€™ll be pleased to know that in 2008 weâ€™re set to announce cooperation with a large number of NHS clinics in the UK who want to support their patients with out of hours, minor advice and international services (eg. if they leave the UK on business/vacations). Weâ€™d love to do the same with the Irish systems and think there is also an enormous opportunity for the Irish public healthcare system to leap frog many of the expensive eHealth mistakes made by the NHSâ€™ (such as the Â£12 Billion NPfIT programme) to deliver Irish patients a completely personalized mHealth service that would also take advantage of this countries affinity with mobiles and wireless.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your comments and those we have already received from the interesting readers of your blog.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
<p>Fiona<br />

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://web2.socialcomputingmagazine.com/">Dion Hinchcliffe </a>is playing a blinder at for the last 45 minutes or so over here at Web2.0 Berlin on the subject of widgets, bagdes and gadgets.</p>
<p>Dion took it from scratch and assumed incomplete knowledge of the subject by the audience &#8211; not a bad idea as there are certainly VC&#8217;s, bricks and mortar retailers (&#038; myself) etc present here amongst the geeks.</p>
<p>Here is my attempt at a summary of Dion&#8217;s explanation of the basics:</p>
<p>A <strong>Widget </strong>is a mini programme which can be distributed with a copy and paste  &#8211; many blogging platforms will even allow you to choose from a directory of widgets.  A <strong>Badge </strong>is a display of content which is pulled from other sites i.e. YouTube.   A <strong>Gadget</strong> is a more formal widget model from Google and Microsoft</p>
<p> <em>Key Aspects:</em><br />
-Supreme ease of consumption and distribution, radical ease of use gets the uptake â€“ copy and paste is best<br />
-Connects to their underlying sites to provide value<br />
-Have a business model â€œbaked intoâ€ it driving site traffic, content consumption etc</p>
<p><em>The power of widgets:</em><br />
-Makes your web appâ€™s functionality and content portable<br />
-Users do the work to broaden you products distribution 27/7<br />
-Widgets supply mash-up</p>
<p><em>Who uses widgets and badges:</em><br />
-Consumers and end users<br />
-Developers and prosumers<br />
-Businesses</p>
<p>Finally, Dion is firm in his view that Google will deploy widgets to help them reach their trillion dollar company target.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>Dublin gets a mention in a recent CNET article<a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-13653_1-6794290-1.html">Tech without borders: The world&#8217;s tech hot spots</a><br />

Dublin. For years, Ireland served as a manufacturing and software center for multinationals. The government is now trying to flush out start-ups. A secret weapon: 40 percent of the population is under 25, and a lot of people have work experience from places such as Hewlett-Packard, says David Smith, senior vice president of Enterprise Ireland, a development agency for Irish industry. Some native successes include Haptica (medical devices), Airtricity (wind farms), and Anam (fund transfers via phones).</em></p>
