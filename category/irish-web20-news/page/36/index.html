<div class="entry"><p>The <a href="http://paddysvalley.org/">Paddy's Valley</a> tour by Irish start-ups of Silicon Valley in December has just become an all-island event with the addition of <a href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/">InterTradeIreland</a> to the trip.</p>
<p>InterTrade is a cross-border body that is about all-island trade and business development networks. Paddy's Valley fits into that perfectly and it'll be great to see Northern Irish companies joining the tour.</p>
<p>Expect to see several stories on blognation in the coming weeks on NI start-ups.</p>

<h2><a href="/2007/10/touristr-adds-travel-blogging/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Touristr adds travel blogging">Touristr adds travel blogging</a></h2>

<div class="author">
<img src="/wp-content/themes/default/w2i/authors/3.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="conor" title="conor" />
<small>14th of <a href="/2007/10/">October 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>I've watched <a href="http://www.touristr.com/">Touristr</a> develop over the course of 2007 from a fundamentally useful travel site to one that can compete on a global stage with ease. They have tweaked many parts of the site with this new release and lightweight travel blogging is the main new feature.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1575431903/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2266/1575431903_ed91696879.jpg" class="block_center" alt="touristr_front_02" height="277" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The motivation behind Touristr was very simple: find out what a place really has to offer using stories and adventures from other travellers. In the original launch, this was very much built around the idea of users adding flags on Google Maps. In the revamped site, they have pre-added thousands of flags for places of interest so you can just add your stories around that location/attraction.</p>
<p>The big change to the front page is interesting. Many social sites jam-pack the landing page with eye-candy and links in an attempt to show you just how exciting the site really is. I tend to find this incredibly distracting and it makes it harder to find what I need. The other extreme is the Google search bar. It looks like Touristr is taking this approach. Whilst I like the simple look, I think they do need to add a much bigger About link for new visitors.</p>
<p>Their mascot <a href="http://www.touristr.com/user/profile/1">TR</a> is a very smart idea as it changes costumes with each country you are looking at. They have gone with a lighthearted stereotype approach which only the truly anal will find offensive. TR adds a very strong branding to the overall site.</p>
<p>A search for Paris on the home page brings up a Google Map with some flags on it, lots of text links and a lovely set of pictures. One small nit; the map does not auto-center and auto-zoom to Paris which I would expect. Oh ok, I could have meant Paris Texas.</p>
<p>Below the map is a set of filtering icons. This is one of those forehead slapping features which overcomes one of my biggest search engine annoyances: Is it <em>AND</em> or <em>&#038;</em>? Can I use <em>and</em> or must it be <em>AND</em>?. The filters make complete sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1575407957/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2190/1575407957_f321bb446c.jpg" class="block_center" alt="touristr_results_01" height="362" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I clicked on the Eat filter and the list of results was refined. Amongst them I spotted Au Petit Riche where a group of us ate during Le Web 3 last December. Clicking on that provided an accurate description of it plus a text box where you could immediately add your own story and your own pictures. Others can indicate whether your story was interesting or not and add comments. Very slick and very simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1576299044/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/1576299044_c13343d701.jpg" class="block_center" alt="touristr_petitriche_01" height="273" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>You can also Rate, Save and Recommend a destination. Of course there are RSS feeds for every destination too so you can keep an eye on new stories for places and venues you like. Every user has an RSS feed so your friends can follow your stories and pictures as you travel.</p>
<p>Of all the travel sites I've tried recently (and I've tried a LOT!), Touristr is the one which fits best into my way of working. Instead of the usual 4000 reviews of a Marriott in New York, I hope it becomes a source of unique information for the intelligent and inquisitive traveller. They have some major features coming which I'm looking forward to trying out since they'll make travelling even easier again.</p>

<p>Thank you for this comprehensive review. You're making a good point about the home page. Showing the right amount of information and content to give directions to users and in the same time keeping it simple is a real art!<br />
Since our initial release in private beta, we've been adding and removing things constantly from the home page. We'll be adding screencasts soon and we'll definitely consider more about TouristR info.</p></p>

<div class="entry"><p>I've just heard about this interesting event that is on <a href="http://dublin.startupweekend.com/">from December 7th to 9th</a>. The main <a href="http://www.startupweekend.com/">Startup Weekend</a> site says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Have you ever wondered what a group of highly talented and motivated people could accomplish in a weekend? Could they start a company from concept to completion?</p>
<p>StartupWeekend answers that question and more. A unique three-day experience, StartupWeekend brings the best and brightest people together in a local office space to select the concept, break into teams, and develop the product, marketing and revenue model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the sound of this. We tried to get a lightweight version of this off the ground for Web2Ireland week but it didn't happen.</p>
<p>It looks like those who take part over the weekend get equity in any company that results. You can participate in one of several different roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer- Sys Admin</li>
<li>Developer- BackEnd</li>
<li>Developer- Architect</li>
<li>Developer- Front End</li>
<li>PR</li>
<li>User Experience</li>
<li>Designer</li>
<li>Legal</li>
<li>Cook</li>
</ul>
<p>I see that at least two companies have been created so far: <a href="http://www.scrolltalk.com/">scrolltalk</a> and <a href="http://www.tipdish.com/">tipdish</a>. It would be interesting to hear stories from those who have attended one of the five so far held around the world.</p>

<p>It looks like EI is not aware of this either. </p>
<p>The person who contacted me was on UK number so perhaps it is being done remotely like MashupCamp? Did I see a Python Ireland person on the blogroll?</p>

<p>I've never heard of the people that are involved in this. Still a long way to go to have an all-aware tech community in Ireland.</p></p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>I attended the very impressive Mid West Entrepreneur Showcase in <a href="http://www.lit.ie/">Limerick Institute Of Technology</a> yesterday. This was a mix of display-stands by start-ups, many from the <a href="http://www.eac.ie/">Enterprise Acceleration Centre</a> and some talks on fund-raising and building businesses. I will never tire of hearing Jerry Kennelly talking about selling Stockbyte for $135m to Getty Images.</p>
<p>The start-ups ranged from hardware guys to Web2 guys and one called <a href="http://www.youbookin.ie/">You Book In</a> caught my eye. They only launched last week but I've a feeling this is going to take off fast. I talked to Conor O'Neill (seriously, that's now 4 of me I know of, ignoring the pub chain in the US) about this site which is for anyone who wants to provide a web/mobile based appointment booking system for their customers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1488997304/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1137/1488997304_adcd89d1e5.jpg" class="block_center" alt="youbookin" height="178" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The idea is utterly simple but very well executed. Instead of using paper based systems or obscenely priced EPOS bolt-ons and taking up the time of a staff member, professional service providers point their customers to the <a href="http://www.youbookin.com/">You Book In</a> site where they can make their own appointments. Confirmation is by email and SMS. You can also set an SMS reminder.</p>
<p>Each market niche has its own custom fields like Preferred Stylist and the system returns the nearest available slots to you if the parameters you set cannot be matched exactly. You can also re-schedule whenever you like and Paypal is integrated for pre-payment if it is appropriate. I wondered if some customers will want their own branded booking site with the service provided as a white label but Conor wants to tap the potential viral effects of e.g. beauticians using it to book a dentist and then signing up for the service themselves.</p>
<p>The wide range of businesses that could benefit from such a simple service is enormous and the guys are very ambitious with an office in the US already. The pricing is very aggressive too with the core service only costing €36 a month. They may have some issues with convincing Doctors to use this due to confidentiality. However for most others, as long as they have a broadband connection in their business, it should be an easy sell.</p>

<small>3rd of <a href="/2007/10/">October 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Foretal</a>, a new site based in Malta using IP developed in Ireland has just launched. It is built around users making predictions and voting on the predictions of others. The cunning twist is that you can do either part for free or for money.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1478075192/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1234/1478075192_5009d35a4d.jpg" class="block_center" alt="foretal01" height="192" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Betting sites like PaddyPower are very popular in Ireland but they currently don't provide a way for you to propose things to bet on. Foretal allows you to do it on anything. Many of the predictions on the site are currently either politics or sport but I expect the range to increase as people realise that the possibilities are unlimited.</p>
<p>The way it works is quite simple. Each time you vote on a prediction for free, you get a credit. Make five credits and you can post your own prediction for free. If you prefer, you can pay €5 to make a prediction and others can vote yes/no for money too. Once the closing date has passed, some of the money that has been bet is dispersed to those who voted correctly and to the predictor.</p>
<p>The site itself looks beautiful and the user interface is very easy to understand but painfully slow. I honestly love this site since I was looking to bet on the outcome of some reality TV show recently but couldn't find it on PaddyPower. Some of the things I can imagine people predicting and voting on are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental disasters</li>
<li>Junta evictions</li>
<li>Deaths and marriages of famous people</li>
<li>Court case outcomes</li>
<li>Election outcomes in other countries</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1478075364/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1401/1478075364_bdc6bf9adb.jpg" class="block_center" alt="foretal02" height="240" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Win/Lose is very simply done on the basis of coverage by three web-sites. The first two are from a drop down list of news organisations like the BBC and you can decide the third one.</p>
<p>The mix of free/pay is a very smart move with the free side reminding me a little of <a href="http://www.jyte.com/">Jyte</a>. The requirement to vote before you can predict for free will drive up usage. The two things I'd like to see added are widgets so I can show what I'm predicting/voting on my blog/MySpace and RSS feeds for new predictions from each of the categories.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about the Malta angle. <a href="http://web2ireland.org/2007/10/02/mayo-news/">According to Julian Ellison</a> it is because Malta has the best on-line gaming regulatory framework. As with all of these sites, people in the USA cannot legally use it.</p>
<p>I've made my first prediction. See if you can figure out which one it is.</p>

<p>Thanks Conor  sorry to hear that you founds things slow, we'll look into that, but nonetheless thanks for your very kind remarks. </p>
<p>Incidently, if you look at the public profile of your prediction, you can find two links. One which gives you an RSS feed, and the other as a normal link. They are:</p>

<div class="entry"><p>A friend of mine in London met some people selling Viagra over the 'net last week. Last year they claim to have made £750,000 clear profit with a team of three people, and all through deft manipulation of their meta-data to get them up the Google rankings. And there we all are worrying about business models. When I hear stories like this, I do wonder whether I am making my business life more complicated than it needs to be, but in the spirit of openness, here's what we're doing so you can judge for yourself:</p>
<p><strong>Whatever happened to <a href="http://www.tablane.com/">Tablane</a>?</strong> Some of you may remember the browser we released a couple of years ago and our aspiration to make Internet research more productive. It&#8217;s still the only browser with a five star user rating on <a href="http://www.download.com/Tablane-Browser-with-TClipper/3000-2356_4-10659847.html?tag=lst-0-1">Download.com</a>, but, we've taken in just €100 in revenue from our TClipper tool and decided to go in a different direction. <strong>We are now collaborating with the <a href="http://www.deri.org/">Digital Enterprise Research Institute</a> of NUI Galway</strong> using some of their semantic smarts <strong>to build a new type of document search platform</strong>. It's all very buggy and alpha at the moment, but it's interesting. Hats off to the <a href="http://www.bmwassembly.ie/">Border Midlands and West Assembly </a>for helping to fund this through their voucher scheme.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.intimemedia.com/">InTimeMedia</a>, our mobile technology business</strong>, has been doing steady work for the BBC and is looking for investment and new customers. We got <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/ResearchInnovate/R+and+D+Collaboration/Innovation+Partnerships.htm">Innovation Partnership</a> funding with Enterprise Ireland back in April which was handy. <strong>We've created an excellent framework for application development and can literally script new applications in minutes, plus our ability to synchronise apps with broadcast programmes has big wow factor.</strong> But the broadcasting industry in the UK has been in a flap over dodgy phone-ins, and corporate restructuring which slowed things. It looks like we're coming out of that now, and we've started approaching the Irish market too, so fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, have you been to <a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Foretal.com</a>? </strong>This exciting venture has had its technology developed in Ireland, funded by angels, but licensed its IP to an operational company in Malta. Why? Because Malta has the best on-line gaming regulatory framework, and boy, is it rigorous. <strong>Foretal &#8212; a portal, foretelling the future &#8212; is a social site for people with an interest in the future. You can make predictions, and vote on the predictions of others. You can do this for free or for cash.</strong> We opened it up after two years of development last week. Your registrations and comments would be much appreciated. It's very exciting, and potentially a customer for the platform we're developing with DERI. <a href="http://www.foretal.com/">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we've just completed a left field project for <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/">Somerset House</a> in London in conjunction with two artists Langlands and Bell. It's called <strong><a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/visual_arts/superactive_i2i_by_langlands__bell/default.asp">Superactivei2i</a> and involves a 3D model of the courtyard of Somerset House, links to flash movies, avatars, chat features and 'see what I see' functionality whereby someone can control what someone else is seeing in their browser.</strong> We used Westport based <a href="http://www.amt3d.com/">AMT3D</a> to laser scan the courtyard and build the model, while Norwegian company <a href="http://www.myvr-software.com/">myVR</a> supplied the cutting edge 3D streaming technology. Best to use IE7.0 with pop-ups turned on for best effect (and doesn't work on the Mac yet). </p>
<p>Probably be easier to sell Viagra wouldn&#8217;t it!?</p>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.xiam.com/">Xiam Technologies</a> announced last week that Vodafone Ireland and Orange UK have signed up to use their MPOS (My Personal Offers System) technology to serve ads on their Mobile Internet portals.</p>
<p>It looks like this is the next logical progression in context sensitive advertising where mobile actually has a leg-up on web advertisers by knowing your history in addition to your current activity. They claim to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-to-one Targeting Technology</li>
<li>Advanced Profiling Techniques which targets advertising to specific market segments and individuals</li>
<li>Ad targeting using Demographic, Contextual, and Behavioural profiling</li>
<li>Real-Time Intelligent Recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mobile operator knows pretty much everything about your history and activity including your location. Of course it is pitched as a way of providing you with accurate information but it'll be interesting to see if this technology is used on a subscriber opt-in basis or whether you suddenly find yourself shocked by spookily accurate mobile advertising.</p>
<p>I'm a privacy sceptic; everything I do on the web or the phone is based on the assumption that I have none. In fact I like getting targeted accurate advertising instead the generic rubbish that Yahoo Mail generally tries to push on me. I'll happily swap my attention data for good discounts on products and services I like. But I'm not sure that is a mainstream position. How do you feel about ads based on knowing lots about you?</p>

<p>Looks great in principle, and should work a treat. However, the relevance and context will all be around what the advertiser is looking for rather than what the customer is looking for. So it just means that those loan, insurance and credit card ads are better targeted rather than directing stuff to me that I am actually interested in. And that boils down to where the money is unfortunately.</p>
<p>There are also plenty folks around who are paranoid about their personal privacy. And on top of that, when you are paying good money to a company for a service, you don't expect to be tracked (without express permission) so that they can make even *more* money from you. A balance needs to be found and I'm very interested to see if they manage to find the balance or whether the dollar signs will win.</p>
<p>Keep us posted!</p></p>

<h2><a href="/2007/09/rte-news-on-twitter/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to RTE News on Twitter">RTE News on Twitter</a></h2>

<div class="author">

<div class="entry"><p>This may be old news but I've just discovered that there are now <a href="http://www.rte.ie/">RTE</a> Twitter accounts. I actually found out about it whilst testing the new tracker functionality.</p>
<p>There is:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtenews">RTE News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtesport">RTE  Sport</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtebusiness">RTE Business</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rtearts">RTE Arts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst there are a reasonable number of RSS feeds on RTE, I'm a fan of adding some news sites to Twitter and Jaiku so I get instant IMs for stuff as it happens. It is not clear if these accounts were created by RTE or someone else since they are just using <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a> for it. Given that they are using RTE logos, I hope it is an official effort.</p>
<p>It did however highlight a flaw in the new Twitter feature. I set the alert for #cork but it sent me an RTE news story with the word cork. This is a really bad idea and I hope it's an early bug.</p>

<p>There is LOADS of services like it on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/News+Services" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.pbwiki.com/News+Services</a></p>
<p>The BBC is very open about their content. <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Plus it's not as if I'm claiming it as my own or trying to pass it off as someone elses. I could easily use the user name for evil and complain about RTÃ‰ News!?</p>
</p>

<p>Then I'd be very wary about using their logos. Good intentions don't count if they get litigious on you.</p>

<p>Sorry Conor It isn't official and you'd be waiting for anything official from them i'd say.</p>
