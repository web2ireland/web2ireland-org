		<description><![CDATA[Hey Will. It&#039;s not the idea of an Irish Facebook that&#039;s the problem, I was pointing out that it&#039;s not a sufficient suggestion. More detail would be required.

Feel free to suggest DiasporaBook by email. I&#039;d check out Geni first tho. We use it in our family and it is currently on a valuation of $100m.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why would an &quot;Irish Facebook&quot; be a bad idea. Of course it needs a twist...

DisporaBook. Same idea, but you don&#039;t link as such... You create a family tree. And go down the paths/branches of the tree, joining with other trees along the way.
you finally get to find out who your third cousin 4 times removed is. Find out that your great great great great grandfather on your mothers side is related to the great great great great grandmother of your next door neighbour.

Would it qualify if it was entered?]]></description>
