<small>31st of <a href="/2007/10/">October 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1810416456/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2236/1810416456_fc51e04941_o.jpg" class="float_left" alt="ticketsolve01" height="121" width="187" /></a> Ticketmaster is the 800-lb middle-gorilla hated by both purchasers and vendors alike. <a href="http://www.ticketsolve.com/">Ticketsolve</a> offers an alternative simple value proposition for small to mid-sized venues and events.</p>
<p>The litany of horror stories about Ticketmaster by ticket purchasers continues unabated. From the inflated charges, problematic site and incorrect billing, it survives due to a semi-monopoly in most countries. However it has problems in equal measure with those who need to get their tickets sold too. This is now being reflected in dropping business with IACâ€™s poor results in July blamed squarely on the Ticketmaster division.</p>
<p>Rather than tackling them head-on, most competitors are going after the areas where Ticketmaster is weak such as the secondary market (<a href="http://www.stubhub.com/">StubHub</a>, <a href="http://www.seatwave.com/">Seatwave</a>). Ticketsolve, as a small start-up, appears to be aiming for smaller local customers and building from that. They to make the entire process of ticket sales simpler for vendors, with an upfront clear pricing model and without the common exclusivity deals forced by Ticketmaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1809571807/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/1809571807_35091ad35f.jpg" class="block_center" alt="ticketsolve02" height="251" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There are a few clear benefits to the site. No set-up fees, flat rate per ticket so it scales with you and, most importantly, the purchase happens on your own site because Ticketsolve integrates into existing sites. Even if the costs were no lower than the competition, this integration must be compelling to anyone looking for further upsell opportunities on their own site. They claim that using their system leads to 34% online sales increase and 28% lower costs. Iâ€™d be interested to see what these are compared against.</p>
<p>There are three obvious markets for this service: disgruntled customers of other ticketing systems, small venues who want something that scales with them and venues that have yet to implement online ticketing. A small cinema local to me has completely removed all electronic ticketing presumably for cost reason and perhaps something like TicketSolve would bring them back into the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1810416742/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2045/1810416742_85c1460c53.jpg" class="block_center" alt="ticketsolve03" height="178" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Since there is a plethora of venues and events in Ireland every day, there is an immediate local market for this service. The case studies they highlight include The Dublin International Film Festival, The Mermaid Arts Centre and The Dundalk Ice Dome. I walked through the purchase flow for tickets on the Ice Dome and it was as seamless as Ticketsolve claims. They can easily grow this business organically on a country by country basis.</p>

<p>I work for a company in the United States that has been around for about seven years, called Brown Paper Tickets. It sounds like Ticketsolvesâ€™ operating philosophy is much like ours. Viva la revolucion! Momentum is building around the globe! Iâ€™m excited to see where all this goes..</p>

<p>Great point about listings and pollution Sean.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m looking forward to your future announcements!</p>

<p><b>Comment posted by Sean Hanly</b><br />at 11/1/2007 8:30:45 AM
<p>Great to see an overall positive response. </p>
<p>To pick up on some of the points mentioned:</p>
<p>- TM (in the guise most of us know them anyways) is not the big player in the end of the market we are playing in &#8211; mid to end of the tail to use long tail metaphor. The venues and festivals do not tend to use TM and TM does not provide them with the demand that they would for example drive towards higher end concerts.</p>
<p>- Most of the impetus for sale for our clients are there own marketing initiatives  whether it be newspaper, direct, etc. Very rarely is it a browsing situation.</p>
<p>- The listings is something we may to look at in the future. However this space has been â€˜pollutedâ€™ by existing providers who tend:<br />
 &#8211; take ownership of data and relationship through some type of membership scheme<br />
 &#8211; excessive charges justified by referrals that often times are not true referrals.<br />
 &#8211; we as a policy do not take any ownership of the client data or interfere in the relationship because of this.</p>
<p>- On the entertainment.ie style partnership all I would say is watch this space.</p>
</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t actually realise that IAC would be doing their Q3 results yesterday! </p>
<p>The story on Ticketmaster was â€œmargin still declining due to operating cost increases but operating income up 9%. Expecting flat or up slightly in Q4?.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by Conor O&#8217;Neill</b><br />at 11/1/2007 4:42:41 AM
<p>Iâ€™d love to see an analysis of point-of-origin for ticket sales for different event types. i.e. where did the impetus for the sale come from: newspaper ad, billboard, word of mouth, the event/venue site itself or from Ticketmaster direct. </p>
<p>For all those events and venues where you already know what you want, Ticketmaster has no advantage. For times where you are looking for something to attend and just want to browse, obviously they have the upper hand.</p>
<p>One thing Ticketsolve could do there is have a portal site with listings only (or partner with equivalent of Entertainment.ie) that then re-direct people to the event/venue sites themselves.</p>

<p>A note to the guys if they are reading this, my wife is a county arts officer and programmes events year round. This would be ideal for her and all the other arts offices around the country. Might be worth giving them a shout.</p>

<p>Its a great idea and i hope it works. Back when running events for the Designers Guild we went with a similar start-up (less web, more phone and email) in Dublin and found the service great and costs a fraction of ticketmaster. The problems they had was in building enough momentum against the monster Ticketmaster. It was catch 22 for venues. While very expensive ticketmaster had the audience so venues were afraid of low attendance if they didnt go with them, even if they earned less money. I donâ€™t believe the start-up survived.</p></p>

<small>27th of <a href="/2007/10/">October 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Iâ€™m getting a bit sick of mashups like â€œfind the nearest Twitter users in a Starbucks with free wifi using Google Mapsâ€ with the map centred firmly on downtown San Francisco. Guess what? We have one Starbucks in Munster, the wifi ainâ€™t free and Google Maps in rural Ireland is rubbish.</p>
<p>But that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not excited by the arrival of <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a> in Dublin because I see the opportunity for something very different to happen here. Iâ€™d like to see the bulk of the APIs and applications being discussed, used and mashed up to be of European origin. Is this feasible? Of the top of my head I came up with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.jaiku.com/">Jaiku API</a></li>
<li>RSS/ATOM from a thousand sources</li>
<li><a href="http://www.multimap.com/apidocs/1.2/">Multimap API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pixenate.com/pixenate/docs/API-Reference.html">Pixenate API</a></li>
<li>Does <a href="http://blog.nooked.com/feedcommerce-an-introduction">Nooked FeedCommerce</a> have an API yet?</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thinkphp.de/archives/201-Playing-with-the-Xing-API.html">Xing API</a> open yet?</li>
<li>Does <a href="http://www.segala.com/">Segala</a> have a Content Label API?</li>
<li><a href="http://share.skype.com/sites/devzone/2007/10/mashups_development_continues.html">Skype API</a></li>
<li>SemWeb and Microformats experts like <a href="http://dannyayers.com/">Danny Ayers</a>, <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian Suda</a> and <a href="http://tommorris.org/blog/">Tom Morris</a> are all based in Europe &#8211; Something with <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec">GRDDL</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>There must be many more, letâ€™s hear about them!</p>
<p>Just in case you think this will just be a talk-shop, I asked <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/">David Berlind</a> for some examples of outputs from previous camps. He pointed me to the impressive <a href="http://www.chime.tv/">ChimeTV</a> which uses a mashup approach to tune in to channels that in-turn aggregate video from across multiple sources. He also mentioned FutureBOSTON which prototyped some ideas for what the urban planning tools of tomorrow might look like. He has a video of a very neat Salesforce mashup from a previous camp <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=661">here</a>.</p>
<p>The only way you are going to learn about all of these is to attend. Mashup University is happening Nov 10-11 and Mashup Camp is Nov 11-12, both in the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin. You need <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/mc2regform.html">to register</a> to attend. See you there!</p>

<div class="entry"><p>The lovely people at CMP have made a few more tickets available to me for European bloggers who wish to attend the full<a href="http://berlin.web2expo.com/"> Web2Expo</a> Conference. This looks like an amazing few days from November 5th to 8th with a multi-stream conference, great keynote speakers, workshops and an expo. Not only that but our own Nicole Simon of blognation Germany is running <a href="http://berlin.web2expo.com/conference/web2open.php">Web2Open</a> which is the unconference part of the week.</p>
<p>How do you get your hands on a pair of these tickets? Simply write a blog post (in English) linking over to this one explaining why you should get the tickets and which parts of the conference are most interesting to you. Weâ€™ll pick our favourite post and hand over the access codes.</p>
<p>You must be willing to attend the conference and obviously youâ€™ll have to cover the cost of your own travel and accommodation.</p>
<p>As the conference is coming up very soon, the closing date is tomorrow (Saturday) midnight BST.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Weâ€™re delighted to reveal that the winner of the two tickets is Ute Moritz. Congratulations Ute, we hope you have an amazing few days at the event.</p>

<div class="author">
<img src="/wp-content/themes/default/w2i/authors/1.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="admin" title="admin" />
<small>25th of <a href="/2007/10/">October 2007</a> by admin</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Over 150 people attended yesterdayâ€™s â€œInnovating the Business Modelâ€ event at Stillorgan Park Hotel.  Headlining the bill for day was <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/chesbrough.html">Prof. Henry Chesbrough </a>who is Executive Director of the Centre for Open Innovation at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>Prof. Chessbroughâ€™s message revolves around the notion that the best innovation stems from the use by firms of external as well as internal ideas to create value and increase growth.  From the classic Xerox example and the relatively recent iPod examples, he presented a compelling case.  </p>
<p>Although he did not explicitly mention web2.0, the relevance was extremely obvious.  A particular thought which  occurred to me following his talk was whether Irish web2.0 companies could follow this thinking to its ultimate conclusion and collaborate on new services.  The inconvenient reality of who would ultimately â€œownâ€, drive and manage such ventures is an obvious issue but maybe not impossible to figure out.</p>
<p>Other speaks on the day included:</p>

<div class="entry"><p>Iâ€™m one of the speakers at <a href="http://ictireland-accel.com/">an upcoming event</a> in Dublin which is concerned with maximising the marketing opportunities offered by social software and social networks.</p>
<p>The line-up right now is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lionel Alexander, VP Hewlett Packard</li>
<li>MicheÃ¡l Martin TD, Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</li>
<li>Dr Breffni Tomlin, Academic Director of National Institute of Technology Management, UCD</li>
<li>Open Forum with Aisling McCabe of RTE ePublishing,  Richard Moyles of furniture.ie and myself</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two keynote speakers; Regis McKenna is a Silicon Valley Marketing legend who has helped launch many of the seminal technology products of the past thirty years including those of Intel, Apple and Genentech; Micheal Platt is a Microsoft Architecture strategist and will talk about Enterprise 2.0</p>
<p>Itâ€™s refreshing to see ICT Ireland, UCD and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment involved and interested in this area. This is not your usual echo-chamber conference and Iâ€™ll be particularly interested to get mainstream audience feedback during the open forum. I fully expect to hear plenty of confused or doubting voices.</p>

<img src="/wp-content/themes/default/w2i/authors/1.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="admin" title="admin" />

</div>

<div class="entry"><p><img src="http://mashupcamp.com/icons/newmashupcamplogo.gif" alt="mashupcamp" /></p>
<p>Where: <a href="http://www.guinness-storehouse.com/">The Guinness Storehouse, Dublin, Ireland</a><br />
When:  November 10-12, 2007<br />
What:  John Musser, Founder, ProgrammableWeb.com and Chad Dickerson (Director Yahoo! Developer Network) among the keynote speakers at one of the best hands-on development conferences in the world!</p>
<p><strong>Who&#8217;s it for</strong>: Primarily developers, plus anyone with a passion for technology, or a burning need to understand how to use the new APIs being offered via Yahoo!, Google, Microsoft, Netvibes, Skype, EBay, Amazon and others. </p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong>: The mashup camp is a mix of speaking, education, and attendee-driven sessions, organised over three days, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.chaddickerson.com/blog/">Chad Dickerson</a>: Sr. Director, Yahoo! Developer Network and driving force behind Yahoo&#8217;s APIs<br />
John Musser, Founder, <a href="http://programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb.com</a> &#8211; the world&#8217;s leading online resource for open APIs and Mashups<br />
Woodson Martin, Marketing Director, EMEA Region, Salesforce.com &#8211; one of the innovators in online CRM solutions</p>
<p><strong><br />
Education! Hands-on with Mashup University:</strong></p>
<p>This part of the conference focuses specifically on learning how to use some of the many APIs and development tools now at your disposal. It&#8217;ll cover 1.5 days of hands-on instructional material on how to use a variety of APIs and development tools to build mashup applications.  The lineup of &#8220;classes&#8221; starts with a series of entry level classes designed for the beginner taught by TagCloud.com inventor John Herren (pictured right).</p>
<p>After John wraps up his introductory level classes on mashup programming, we&#8217;ll be diving into some advanced content, including:<br />
- IBM&#8217;s QED Wiki-based tools for mashup software development.<br />
- Microsoft&#8217;s PopFly, Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Live,<br />
- Mashup development tools from Serena and Kapow<br />
- AOL&#8217;s  APIs</p>
<p><strong>Mashup Camp:</strong></p>
<p>Once the education section concludes, Mashup Camp will begin. The idea is that the attendees drive the agenda for this section of the conference. At the start, attendees propose discussions around the topics that are of the most interest and relevance to the people in the room. Although formal presentations are allowed, the most vibrant sessions are the ones where the person who proposed the discussion in the first place kicks the discussion off and keeps in on track, but invites others to participate and contribute. This approach has worked well for Barcamp and a range of other informal, technology-centric conferences.</p>
<p>Win cool prizes &#8211; for real!!!</p>
<p>Win an Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer!!! How? Mashup developers are invited to enter their mashups into the Best Mashup Contest. The mashup developers must then make their best pitch before the attendees, who vote on which is the best mashup. During the Camp&#8217;s closing ceremonies, we award a first, second, and third place prize.  At Mashup Camp Dublin, the first place prize will be an Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer.</p>
<p><strong>Fun in Dublin</strong><br />
What good would the newest technology event to come to Dublin be without a visit to one of the city&#8217;s traditional pubs? In addition to the free meals we&#8217;ll be offering to Campers during Mashup University and Mashup Camp, we invite you to join us for a night of local indulgence and food at The Bankers on 16 Trinity Street on Sunday Evening (November 11th).</p>
<p><strong>Cost and sign up  </strong></p>
<p>To sign up for Mashup Camp or for more information, please be sure to visit the Mashup Camp Web site at <a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">www.mashupcamp.com</a>. Alternatively, you can write to Mashup Camp&#8217;s founders David Berlind and Doug Gold. Write to: <a href="mailto:david@masseventslabs.com">David</a> or <a href="mailto:doug@masseventslabs.com">Doug</a>. </p>
<p>Lastly, whereas non-sponsoring technology providers and venture capitalists are asked to pay an attendance fee in support of Mashup Camp, developers are only asked to make a nominal payment of 25 Euros. However, we don&#8217;t want the 25 Euro payment to be an impediment to your ability to attend. Should that be a little too tight for your budget, let us know via e-mail and we&#8217;ll be happy to waive the nominal fee.</p>
