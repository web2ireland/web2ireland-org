		<description><![CDATA[Daniel,

I do agree that u need 2 have your eyes open when u&#039;re looking to do any &quot;deal&quot; and giving up some of your company.

I&#039;m not gonna make any pro/con&#039;s for that 5% and what u get back in &#039;value&#039;. That is for each startup 2 evaluate and each will have their own story, what stage they are at, what help they need ...

However I will say that its only suitable 4 those at a very early stage. If your beyond that then u should have other issues 2 fry

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a nice idea but giving away 5% of your company for $5-15k seems a bit steep. I know the networking etc. is valuable and but $15k (only â‚¬11300) won&#039;t even cover the personal costs for three people for 3 months.  I get the impression this is aimed at college kids. 

Also the fact that http://www.techstars.org/ is broken (Cannot select database: Access denied for user &#039;&#039;@&#039;localhost&#039; to database &#039;h5&#039;) is a little worrying, given that free hosting is part of the offer.

		<description><![CDATA[Conor,

I&#039;m hoping at some stage to &#039;help&#039; with a similiar event in IRL. Time will tell ..when...

I don&#039;t know what the &#039;time period&#039; is as part of a &#039;holiday&#039; stay. Certaintly the US customs/immigration systems have increased in tracking capability since 9/11. 
I&#039;m sure US Embassy in Dublin or some on the EI side (that travels back-n-forth or on &#039;secondment&#039;) will know the answer here.

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great idea Brendan, I hope it can be replicated here too eventually. I&#039;d love it if a bunch of &quot;youngfellas&quot; could head over, do it and bring back a bunch of valuable experience and seed the same idea here.

I wonder if the old trick we used back in &#039;96 with immigration still works? In another start-up we were all sent over for &quot;training&quot; to our customer for 5 months. No-one seemed to mind and it was win-win all round. Not sure if we needed formal visas or just the right phrases in the airport :-) 

Actually, this could easily be considered real training for visa purposes.]]></description>
