		<description><![CDATA[Its a good list and good advice, but I would add a caveat. This is a &quot;super&quot; list in that its the combined behaviour of a multitude of VCs taken as a whole. The VC you choose may have more or less of the defects/benefits listed above.

Also if you&#039;re running a business and your paying to much attention to your VC&#039;s advice you have rocks in your head the size of gibralter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dunno. For example, items 2 and 3 are fairly no brainer (in my, admittedly limited, experience). Would you disagree? 9 and 12 also ring particularly true for me - again - based on direct experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have to grumble.  I thought there may have been a single point I would agree with and believed so until I read each point.

Granted, who wants to buy a half baked cake was the old mind set. VCs these days are a lot sharper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally I wouldn&#039;t take advice from someone (doesn&#039;t matter how others respect them) from someone with a blog that&#039;s actually a static 1.0 Web site that looks like a blog. This shows a complete lack in understand/appreciation for current thinking... This is actually a blog post I&#039;ve been meaning to write for ages. 

Speaking to Donncha from Wordpress... in his words &#039;blogs without comments is pure evil&#039;.]]></description>
