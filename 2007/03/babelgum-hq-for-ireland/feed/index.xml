		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hijack your space. 

But, you might be interested in the next NW Startup 2.0 event in Manchester UK. Please visit http://www.nwstartup20.co.uk/ for further detail. This event is free to attend. Last event was attended by Irish entrepreneur Paul Segala. We plan to extend the May 07 event to include international speakers. It would be great if we can have Irish presence. 

Many thanks
