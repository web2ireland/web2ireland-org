<div class="entry"><p>The <a href="http://www.intertradeireland.com/module.cfm/opt/25/area/News/page/News/id/272">Seedcorn</a> winners for 2007 are Movidia as Best International Emerging Company and Openplain as Best Emerging Company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.movidia.com/">Movidia</a> won the â‚¬100k prize due to their mobile processor technology which is targeted at activities like mobile gaming. I worked many years ago in S3 with their CEO Sean Mitchell and Iâ€™m not surprised to see him do so well. After S3 he worked in Parthus and Silansys so Movidia is a logical progression for him. You can expect to see some unique IP from these guys. Of course the challenge (as in Parthus) is to secure licencees. Competition in this space continues to be intense and it is not necessarily the best IP which gets the deals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openplain.com/">Openplain</a> which won the â‚¬50000 prize provides productivity tools so that employees and employers can track and manage their time and application use more efficiently. They can also use it to compare their work performance to that of peers, team, department and company averages. Businesses like call centers live and die by productivity and require tools like this to constantly monitor and refine. Itâ€™ll be interesting to see what unique benefits this tool brings as I have seen similar in the market for many years. On a side note, as a blogger, seeing a product called JournalLive really grates!</p>
<p>Itâ€™s good to see that Seedcorn has overcome their slight obsession with life sciences and is looking again at both hardware and software. A useful exercise each year would be for them to look back and see how all the previous winners are doing.</p>

<small>29th of <a href="/2007/11/">November 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://www.swarmteams.com/">Swarmteams</a>, the mobile social network, has just launched <a href="http://home.swarmteams.com/music">its Music service</a> to bring bands and fans together. The upside for bands is obvious &#8211; grow the fanbase, motivate existing fans to buy more and help with organising live gigs. For fans its an opportunity to feel more part of a community around the bands you love.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/2075766124/" title="swarmteams_music_01.png by blognation_Ireland, on Flickr"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2255/2075766124_df2d8db994.jpg" class="block_center" alt="swarmteams_music_01.png" height="154" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote very positively about Swarmteams in the past and I continue to think it has the potential to be a global success. Since then, based on my own experiences of building an SMS service, I have become concerned about the complexity of the system. Unless you are an avid user, you will need to bring a cheat sheet with you in order to remember the commands. I wonder if a simpler, less featureful approach for the average punter might be appropriate?</p>
<p>Bands will have to be very careful how they use the system so that they do not alienate fans in an attempt to drive up music or merchandise sales. But I know Iâ€™d be very happy to be part of a Kings of Leon swarm, if such a thing was ever created.</p>
<p>The company has announced that a number of UK bands will be able to use the system for free for a year through sponsorship from <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/">Nesta</a>. They already have some bands <a href="http://www.kharma45.com/">from the North</a> using it. I expect to see lots more in the coming months.</p>
<p>On a related topic, Swarmteams would be an ideal co-ordination tool for the <a href="http://www.paddysvalley.org/">Paddyâ€™s Valley</a> trip to Silicon Valley starting on Sunday. There are lots of sub-groups visiting different companies and it could help hugely with everyone knowing what is going on at any particular moment.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll continue to make the same points about mobile over and over. Start-ups like Swarmteams and <a href="http://www.downloadmusic.ie/">DownloadMusic</a> show that there is lots of innovation still possible using something as simple as SMS. With the marketing muscle of O2 or Vodafone behind them, these services could grow very quickly indeed.</p>

<p>Thnaks Conor</p>
<p>If the paddys valley team would like a free account just for their trip then just ask one of them to get in touch with me directly and I will set it up for them. All they need is a nominated â€œPaddys Valley Swarm Community Ownerâ€ and this person can invite everyone else who can then create their own swarms all in the same swarm community.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Ken</p>

<p>Thanks Ken. Would definitely like to hear about how live users are getting on with it. Iâ€™ve had several of those â€œmomentsâ€ recently, like Paddyâ€™s Valley, where I thought â€œye know, Swarmteams would be ideal hereâ€.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by ken thompson</b><br />at 11/30/2007 1:49:48 PM
<p>Good point on the fan alienation front &#8211; thats where the swarmteams reputation and message ranking system comes in</p>
<p>If a band or an alpha fan sends out stuff the fans dont want then their swarmteams digital reputation will get trashed and no-one will stay in their swarms</p>
<p>The only thing I would take issue with on the article is your useability comments.</p>
<p>Although the system is feature rich there is nothing a music fan needs to remember &#8211; no cheat sheet required</p>
<p>For ordinary fans to reply to an Band SMS they just reply to the text as if you were texting a friend &#8211; no commands </p>
<p>If you are an Alpha Fan then there are really there are just 3 commands which cover almost everything</p>
<p>TELL SWARMNAME This Message &#8211; broadcast to swarm and route all replies to the web messageboard</p>
<p>ASK SWARMNAME This Question &#8211; broadcast to swarm and route all replies to my phone too</p>
<p>CHAT SWARMNAME This Topic &#8211; broadcast to swarm and route all replies to all swarm members phones</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested in an interview with one of the music bands who are using it?</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Ken Thompson</p></p>

</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Yesterday I spoke at the ICT Ireland conference on â€œMarketing in a Total Access Worldâ€. The keynote was legendary Marketeer Regis McKenna who had a gem of insight for everyone in the audience. Michael Platt from Microsoft also gave a great whirlwind tour of business and technology with an MSFT twist.</p>
<p>My talk was a very simple personal potted history called â€œdâ€™internet, Being Social 1990-2007?. My basic proposal was that weâ€™ve been social networking since the days of Usenet, but the tools and possibilities improve with each new generation. I also made the prediction that 2008 would be the year of Mobile. Itâ€™s probably been said by someone every year since 1997 but the progress in 2007 with Twitter, Jaiku, iPhone, N95, GPS, cheaper mobile data etc has me convinced we have finally got there.</p>
<p>I was asked if that was realistic given the seeming inability of the mobile operators to build new sticky value-added services. As long as they are in control, is it just a pipe-dream? I replied that they are improving and those Iâ€™ve talked to in the telcos know that things have to change. I also thought that Android could be a way for Google to get apps like Jaiku onto many phones and potentially bypass the operator veto.</p>
<p>Michael Platt agreed wholeheartedly and clearly Microsoft sees mobile as a critical part of their strategy. I then ran into a person from one of the mobile operators who confirmed both the positive and negative aspects &#8211; yes they know they have to change; no, they donâ€™t know how to do that. I suggested that (for example with LBS) they take the Google approach of building APIs and releasing them into the wild to see what people do with them. He admitted that such an approach would be very difficult for them with their current â€œtarget drivenâ€ organisational structure.</p>
<p>Today I woke up to find that Google have added â€œ<a href="http://www.google.com/gmm/mylocation.html?hl=en">My Location</a>â€ to their Mobile Maps application. Using community generated location information which relates mobile tower IDs to GPS locations, you can now get some sense of where you are using your phone even if it does not have GPS. An simple elegant solution to a problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is the future for the mobile operators? They spend their time trying to figure out what the next big thing is and everyone else just finds ways around their roadblocks.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>The <a href="http://2008.blogtalk.net/">fifth BlogTalk conference</a> is happening in Cork on March 3rd and 4th 2008. This event is all about social software with the aim to bring together developers, academics, administrators in corporate and educational settings and others working in this space.</p>
<p>There is an impressive line-up of <a href="http://2008.blogtalk.net/invitedspeakers">invited speakers</a> and Iâ€™m particularly looking forward to hearing Nova Spivack, CEO of <a href="http://www.radarnetworks.com/">Radar Networks</a> who writes with greath depth and insight about the Semantic web on his blog.</p>
<p>Sean McGrath of Propylon <a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2007/11/blogtalk-2008-mashups-microformats-and.html">has announced</a> that he will be speaking and chairing a panel on Mashups, microformats and syndication. Thatâ€™s one I wonâ€™t be missing along with the <a href="http://2008.blogtalk.net/node/20">workshop on Social Network Portability</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst there does seem to be a distinct academic flavour to this conference, the topics are of great importance to many working on the web and it should be a rewarding two days. I was very impressed to see names like Stowe Boyd, Jyri EngestrÃ¶m and Kevin Marks on the various commitees.</p>
<p>Final deadline <a href="http://2008.blogtalk.net/callforproposals">for proposals</a> is December 7th.</p>

<p>Yeah, I like that mix that you are looking for. Some of the more commercial ones can just end up being a litany of product pitches. Looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Hi Conor &#8211; thanks for the mention!</p>
<p><a href="http://2008.blogtalk.net/" rel="nofollow">BlogTalk</a> is less formal than academic conferences but a bit more academic-ey than events like Reboot, LeWeb, etc.  What I think is good is that BlogTalk provides a nice mix, in that it allows practitioners to see what academics or developers are doing, and shows academics and developers what practitioners need. There arenâ€™t that many events like it I think, and Iâ€™d hope that this mix can be sustained this year (going on the proposals weâ€™ve received so far, I think it will be).</p>

<small>22nd of <a href="/2007/11/">November 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>The best news Iâ€™ve heard in a long time in the Irish  funding space happened last night at the Eircom Golden Spiders Awards when <a href="http://home.eircom.net/minisite/WebInnovationFund/">they announced a fund</a> to bootstrap web start-ups. This amount is small but very much in the Y Combinator or SeedCamp model. A stodgy old telco has done something which is frankly stunning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/2057145976/" title="eircom.png by blognation_Ireland, on Flickr"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2341/2057145976_89afe6bd4e.jpg" class="block_center" alt="eircom.png" height="124" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The key is not really the money, it is the opportunities presented by partnering with the most trafficked Irish web-site out there and getting mentoring, support and access to the right people. The areas they are interested in are Web2 generally, Micro-blogging, Embedded Voice Applications, Mashups and Social Networking.</p>
<p>The fund is worth approximately â‚¬100k annually and up to four concepts will be selected each year. They will take proposals that range from paper specs to alpha-level code but the applicants really have to show a capability to build what they are suggesting. The funding can then be used to build the webapp through to production and, if appropriate, initially launch on the eircom.net platform. Once launched, eircom will continue to provide small levels of operational funding for the app/site.</p>
<p>The real shocker comes with the announcement on equity stake. Zero! I donâ€™t want to sound like a starry eyed fanboy, but well bloody done Eircom! Finally someone here gets it and realises that handing over â‚¬175m to VCs is not the way to build incredible new companies. When I heard the zero equity line I was speechless. Of course successful applications are likely to result in content deals and I canâ€™t imagine anyone having an issue if there were first-refusal clauses on future equity stakes (I have no idea if there are).</p>
<p>Details and applications <a href="http://www.eircom.net/innovation">are available here</a> and submissions must be in by February 2008. The details of the areas they are interested in are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery (domain specific search; indexing, ranking, querying techniques; personalisation, recommendations, information aggregation)</li>
<li>Messaging (IM; new / open messaging frameworks; email, alerts)</li>
<li>Voice (VoIP telephony; mashups; asynchronous and embedded voice applications)</li>
<li>Location (mapping; location-based services; geospacial web, location-based content aggregation)</li>
<li>Publishing (blogging and microblogging, syndication; microformats; widgets)</li>
<li>Communities (social networks, open standards, mashups, visualisations, aggregators)</li>
<li>Content creation (music, video, film &#038; TV, gaming, sport, lifestyle)</li>
<li>Advertising (formats, platforms, technologies, networks, targeting, syndication, widgets)<br />
* Identity (presence, capabilities management; lightweight identity platforms, cross-platform solutions, social identity management)</li>
</ul>
<p>The injection of new blood like Mark Taylor and others into Eircom really is shaking things up. There is a realisation by many large companies that it is difficult to innovate internally. So rather than trying to invent the next â€œbig thingâ€, they seed money to startups that have the flexibility and vision to do it and make sure they are there to reap benefits if it works out. If only there were more companies in Ireland willing to try this model. Iâ€™ll say it again, well done Eircom.</p>
