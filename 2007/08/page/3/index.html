<small>13th of <a href="/2007/08/">August 2007</a> by conor</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>blognation Ireland launches today to bring you all the latest news from the world of Web2.0 and mobile in Ireland. 2007 is the year when activity in web development has been at its most exciting here in a long time. Our aim is to raise the visibility of this local activity to a much wider global audience.</p>
<p>The Irish site is part of  the blognation network which is building up to be the biggest tech news site  on non-US Web 2.0 startups around the globe including EMEA, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada.</p>
<p>For a country of only four million people, Ireland has always punched above its weight in many areas. In Web2.0 too, the signs are all good for many start-ups to grow businesses with international appeal.</p>
<p>There is an interesting juxtaposition happening right now between the high energy in building tech businesses and the low usage of those sites by average Irish consumers. The slow uptake in broadband is the main reason for this but we are finally starting to see this change as much of the country can now get access by some means. The buzz in OpenCoffees and BarCamps is now moving to the mainstream.</p>
<p>Ireland is quite unusual in Europe with having almost no home-grown social networking sites where people hang out. Most of the local sites are old-style discussion boards with <a href="http://www.boards.ie/">boards.ie</a> being the granddaddy of them all. Outside of this, global sites like Bebo and MySpace rule. The fact that we don't need own language sites can explain a lot of this. However, the recent launch of <a href="http://www.mysay.com/">mySay </a>hopefully signals the beginning of more truly Irish social networking sites. mySay is a web-site and phone service that lets you record updates, listen to your friends and display them in a widget on your blog.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1092526359/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1434/1092526359_328147e910.jpg" class="block_center" alt="mySay" height="132" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It is well known that the recovery of the Irish economy at the start of the nineties was driven by the arrival of many multinationals. These companies didn't just provide jobs, they provided critical training to a generation of Irish graduates. At the same time as this growth, some of the older tech companies fell by the wayside. The closure of DEC in Galway was thought by many to be a catastrophe. In fact it was the trigger that was needed for a slew of very successful start-ups to get going.</p>
<p>We are now seeing a repeat of this as many of the current generation of multinationals move on to India or China. The recent closure of Motorola in Cork is a terrible shock in the short term but a huge opportunity in the medium term. We know of several new start-ups that have launched as a result of the closure and we hope to cover them in the coming months.</p>
<p>Indigenous tech startups here in the past have tended to be enterprise focused due to the corporate background of many of the founders. It is only in the past two years that we are seeing this change and consumer Web2.0 is now finally seeing a big surge. An interesting example of this is PollDaddy which started as an enterprise survey application but has seen enormous success as a simple embedded poll app for blogs and web-sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1092528809/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1313/1092528809_7b22056f4c.jpg" class="block_center" alt="PollDaddy" height="328" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The single biggest blocking factor for web startups here continues to be access to capital. The State development body, <a href="http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/">Enterprise Ireland</a>, provides a range of assistance including grants, training and mentoring. One drawback of most grants  is that they are done on the basis of matching funds which can be a problem for an average employee who has a killer idea he wants to build on his own. The <a href="http://www.gep.ie/">incubation centres</a> around the country are a big help in filling that gap. There is also an opportunity here for the <a href="http://www.wceb.ie/">County Enterprise Boards</a> which have traditionally supported smaller businesses to get more deeply involved in the web.</p>
<p>The VC scene has been very quiet for at least 18 months due to all of the funds being fully invested. However, last year, the government provided access to  €175m to the VCs as leverage. The first new fund using this, the <a href="http://www.enterpriseequity.ie/news_AIB.html">AIB Seed Capital Fund</a>, has just launched under the management of Enterprise Equity. This fund should be of particular interest to web start-ups as its focus is earlier stage seed investment. Several other new funds including those from Delta and NCB are imminent.</p>
<p>We are also hearing rumblings of three new small tech funds backed by successful entrepreneurs. Are we finally seeing the creation of a Silicon Valley style ecosystem here where money/talent/academia come together and the successful always return to seed the next generation?</p>
<p>The challenges faced by startups here actually mean that Web2.0 has a strong fit to Ireland; low-cost and free tools and technologies which can be used by tiny teams scattered around the country to create compelling web applications. Whilst most enterprise development is centred on a few large population centres, the majority of webapps in Ireland are coming from the long tail of locations.</p>
<p>The Irish obsession with talking and communicating makes us one of the most valuable markets in Europe for mobile operators based on ARPU. Voice and SMS are king here with data/MMS coming in far behind due to the prohibitive rates. Despite this, we expect to see more and more consumer oriented combined Web/Mobile offerings in the coming 12 months. <a href="http://zinadoo.com/">Zinadoo</a> which allows you to create your own personal mobile web-sites is a perfect example of this.</p>

<p>To give you a flavour of some of the other activity around the country, here are a few more examples. We'll be covering lots more of them in the coming months!</p>
<p><a href="http://touristr.com/">Touristr</a><br />
TouristR is a travel site that allows you to plan itineraries for your next holiday, book deals from local providers, post your pics/stories and add your own travel adventures. Currently in Beta.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.segala.com/">Segala</a><br />
Taking their background in compliance testing of sites, the Segala guys are now heavily involved in the use of Semantic metadata to enable codes of conduct on web-sites. The first step is a plug-in for Firefox but eventually they aim to replace PICS.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blognation_ireland/1103414058/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="//farm2.static.flickr.com/1349/1103414058_dff4343506.jpg" class="block_center" alt="Segala" height="282" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Excellent stuff Conor &#8211; great to see Blognation Ireland up and running.</p>
<p>(Your point on social networking for Ireland will (hopefully) soon be addressed by <a href="http://www.social.ie/" rel="nofollow">social.ie</a>, another boards.ie site, which we are currently working on.)</p>

<p>Hi Conor,</p>
<p>well done on the launch of Blognation &#8211; its great to see this type of initiative take off!</p>

<p>Thanks Frank. I hope I wasn't being hard on the boards, they are great resources. It's just a little disappointing we haven't seen many attempts (yet!) to build Irish sites that take advantage of the technology and social advances of the past few years. </p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see the Loman O'Byrne from South Dublin County Enterprise Board using Yahoo Groups for the Tech-Check initiative. </p>
<p>I'd love to see a CEB build their own mini social network using something like Ning, as the <a href="http://opencoffee.ning.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCoffee</a> guys have.</p>
<p>I only discovered today that there is no overall CEB site, just one per county. An aggregated site pulling in all the latest news from the individual sites would be fantastic.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Comment posted by Frank Fullard</b><br />at 8/13/2007 4:56:32 PM
<p>Congrats Conor, but don't be so hard on the old-style discussion boards as you call them. For example there is nothing elsewhere quite like <a href="http://www.Irishbusinesswomen.com/" rel="nofollow">www.Irishbusinesswomen.com</a> the networking site for female entrepreneurs &#8211; which also welcomes men as members! As it's founder I could just possibly be biased! Of course, if anyone has any suggestions as to how we can use new technology to enhance IBW we would be delighted to hear your suggestions. Hopefully Blognation can help us in that regard.</p>
