		<description><![CDATA[Brian,

Why don&#039;t EI setup an RSS feed for all new initiatives and upcoming events. That way, we&#039;ll all get to hear about them. It appears to be disjointed at best and we rely on sharing information with each other.

Cheers big ears

		<description><![CDATA[Barry Egan just popped his head in my door to ask me to thank Lal for the plug and also to point out that the following additional help is available for successful participants;

- 5 x consultancy days with a high quality business consultant to help put your business plan together. When you consider a good business consultant can charge €1k per day easily....

- funding to make an overseas market research trip....would probably get someone to the valley for a few days

Lal already mentioned the grant funding...

...50% of your last salary up to a limit of €38k..eg say you earned a salary of €76k, you could potentially get a grant of €38k to put bread on the table.

Barry also wants to point out that the programme definitely wants to hear from people with good web 2.0 ideas!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that Brendan.  This programme is the latest of a breed of start-up programmes EI is involved with. Many of the start-ups in whose first investment rounds we participate in have cut their teeth on them.  Think about it: 12 months salary support, intros, facilities and like-minded peers etc! This one in particular has a lot of promise.  It is going to be very well resourced and the cross border aspect will give it an interesting dimension.  If people would like to find out more in confidence, my colleague Barry Egan who is the director for NW region, would be happy to talk.  He can be reached at 071 91 59700 or barryDOTeganATenterprise-ireland.com]]></description>
