		<description><![CDATA[It was fun - especially when I decided to spill an entire bowl of curry on myself!

Conn - shame I only saw your post when it was too late. 

Ed, I&#039;ll probably do something like this again in a few weeks if there&#039;s enough interest!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like John, I&#039;ll be at the Digital Media Awards as well.  In fact there&#039;ll be quite a few bloggers there.  Unfortunately, it&#039;s hard to say what time it will be finished.  (Dinner&#039;s at 8:00) If we don&#039;t make it to you, maybe you might like to look in on us later?  It&#039;s in the Burlington.  (Slightly different dress code though!)]]></description>
