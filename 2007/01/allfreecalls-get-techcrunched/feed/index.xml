		<description><![CDATA[Like Futurephone this is taking advantage of an FCC kickback supported by the US Universal Service Fund (USF). This is exploiting a fund the FCC set up to assist states in the US where telecom systems are considered weak, in this case Iowa. Futurephone and Allfrecalls are making money out of the USF/FCC and you for every generated call, you are paying at least 6 cents a minute when long distance calling is not included in your plan. I&#039;m more than sure that this isn&#039;t allowed to continue for long -- that&#039;s really not what the USF is for!]]></description>
