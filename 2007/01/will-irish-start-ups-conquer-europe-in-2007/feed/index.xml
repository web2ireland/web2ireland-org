		<description><![CDATA[At the web3 conference, start ups had to apply and attend the conference but if you were selected, there was no extra costs to present. It&#039;s the same for Innovate Europe in Saragosse next May, if you&#039;re interested registration is still open. The main benefits of these presentations is to facilitate meeting people (I met potential partners and investors following the presentation at the Web3) but it&#039;s certainly not worth 5k! Also if one has to pay to present then I don&#039;t think it would be as attractive for the audience as it&#039;s clearly pure advertising. I&#039;m also thinking of going to future of web apps conference (as an attendee only!), would anyone recommend it?]]></description>
