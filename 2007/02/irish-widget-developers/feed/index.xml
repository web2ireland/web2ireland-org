		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve been playing with building a few widgets  as part of 2 (non-disclosed) business ideas we&#039;re looking at.

I&#039;m yet to be convinced of the business case for Widgets; there are multiple (incompatible) platforms to develop for, and people aren&#039;t yet used to paying for them. The exception to this may be for (viral) marketing purposes.

On the technical side, I&#039;ve found that pretty much any competent programmer can put one together. Your Language (Java/Javascript/.Net) is dictated by the widget platform. While you have an API to learn (slight learning curve) , this is an advantage after the first day or two as you tend to be operating in a restricted environment (= less of other stuff to know / learn).

		<description><![CDATA[We designed one for a development company but are under NDA until it is released. 
We will also be developing style guides for another UK company soon who will be launching a range of widgets under the one brand.
Personally i have not seen the point of most widgets. It seems to be going against everyone else&#039;s move to web based desktops.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bah! 2007 is the year of RSS... no wait... 2007 is the year of vertical search... no wait, the year of browser VOIP?

2007 is basically the year of [insert your technology here].

As for widgets, we are working on some here at the TSSG.

I think they have benefit but to be honest 2007 is going to be the year that the success of widgets will reveal the flaws of widgets (e.g. the slow-down the MyBlogLog widget experienced.)

Not everything has to be a widget, seriously guys.]]></description>
