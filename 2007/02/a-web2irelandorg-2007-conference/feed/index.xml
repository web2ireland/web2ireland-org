		<description><![CDATA[Paul, as you know, Ireland is seen as a cool place to visit, so thatâ€™s one good reason. It&#039;s also seen as a European hub for innovation. Unfortunately, I don&#039;t see much of this industry being raised through Enterprise Ireland as much as say, manufacturing.

I think we should call it Web2Ireland Conference and see if O&#039;Reily publishers have something to say - that&#039;ll raise our profile even further ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will you be able to get a venue to hold all the potential attendees? Judging by the huge jump in Interest in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.awards.ie/blogawards&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Irish Blog Awards&lt;/a&gt; (more than 2000 nominations), what sort of interest would we see in a Web2Ireland conference?
