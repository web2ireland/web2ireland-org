		<description><![CDATA[The thing that&#039;s impressed me about Startupping is the amount of BUZZ! Seriously!  Our site is in a related field but about bringing entrepreneurs together with advisors, angels and VCs but we haven&#039;t had anything near the same buzz factor.  

Is it Mark&#039;s involvement or something else?  I&#039;m stumped! Thoughts?
