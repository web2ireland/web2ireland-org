		<description><![CDATA[Hey Alicia from FON here.  I thought you might be interested hearing about the Fonbucks campaign success:

FON ended up giving away just under 7000 routers; 5,000 more than they anticipated. And these Foneros don't lie! Fon saw a huge increase of Fon hotspots in highly dense, Starbucks populated areas. 

Fon's been having a lot of fun with this campaign. Check out the latest fun with Starbucks and meet Fon's new favorite matador (Joselito):

		<description><![CDATA[Fergus: Hey, it&#039;s Gary from migoa in Barcelona. At least you guys have some signs of life in the UK VC community. The situation here is Spain is pretty tough for financing, though we did just get an angel investor. In our case, it was about being in the right place at the right time--that is, an intimate networking event. Other than that, I&#039;m not sure what we would have done to be able to finance ourselves. Please keep me posted on how the coffeeclubs work for you guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I hope my comment didn't read as a criticism.&quot;

No, not at all Conor, and your post is spot on. Looks like we&#039;ll have Evert Bopp along now as well so that makes three so far. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Completely agree James, I hope my comment didn&#039;t read as a criticism. Get it moving and then try to get others interested. I&#039;m thrilled you guys are running with this. 

Hell, invite Saul over for one and it might embarrass Irish VCs into action!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;However I think a critical aspect of Saul's announcement is that it comes from an investor.&quot;

Very true, but knowing how slow Irish VCs are to come down from their lofty perches I&#039;ll be happy to get the entrepreneurs going along first and then putting it up to the VCs to come join us :-)

Looks like Jan Blanchard and myself, so far, are going to kick-off the Limerick coffee mornings next Thursday.]]></description>
