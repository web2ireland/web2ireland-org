		<description><![CDATA[[...] Fixer asked me to let you all know that one of the doyens of social software and open standards - Marc Canter is coming to Dublin and if you can make it you should dine with the guy on April 26th in the Market Bar. Marc is over for the Web 2.0 conference in Dublin and you should go to that too. Marc&#8217;s enthusiasm for everything is infectious and is well worth hanging around the guy and talking about everything and anything. More details from Conor O&#8217;Neill. I wish I could go but I have college exams a few days later. Oh yes, and I&#8217;ll give good odds to anyone that can party harder than Marc. Check out this podcast of Marc Canter with Tom Raftery.
