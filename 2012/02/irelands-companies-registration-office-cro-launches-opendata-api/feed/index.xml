		<description><![CDATA[Hi Conor,

I believe that we are the first to get this working live. You can see it on our website http://www.irishformations.ie/ I have to say that the CRO were fantastic, and they used us as a test bed for the pilot release of the API.

Irish Formations is a Company Formations agency based in the Atrium Business Centre, in Blackpool Cork City. We form Limited Companies as an outsource facility for Solicitors and Accountants, and we process Company Formations direct through our website for anyone in the need of Limited Liability for their business.

We got frustrated setting up the business last year that this facility was not in place, and I thought that there was no reason why this should not be available. I made contact with the CRO and after a few calls they told me that they love the idea and are actually working on it. After much discussion, and information passed forwards and backwards, we started to prepare for the arrival of this facility on the site. It only went live last week, but it is working well, and we are delighted to be offering it as a free service to anyone who wants to use it to check the availability of a limited company name, or just to check a company number.]]></description>
