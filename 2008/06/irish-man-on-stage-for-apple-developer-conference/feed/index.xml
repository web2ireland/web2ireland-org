		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words, Fergus. Last week was great ... we even bagged an Apple Design Award. I&#039;m told it still counts even though it was a runner-up award. 

Also, to put the record straight, I&#039;m not a VP at AP ... I work with them as Director of Mobile Products. See you in New York soon?]]></description>
