		<description><![CDATA[D4 Heroes!!!!! lol

I like the 4.

I was looking for a verb too- as the site works off subdomains... 

BandonLifeboat.decisionsforheroes.com could be BandonLifeboat.logIncident.com

getLogs.com

getStats.com

liveRescues.com

ourRescues.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The domain is ghastly isn&#039;t it... &#039;decisions&#039; and &#039;heroes&#039; are both impossible spellings. Any suggestions for a &#039;shortcut&#039; domain?

Finetuna is GREAT. And a great name. I specc&#039;d this for http://www.imagefile.ie/ 1.5yrs ago as a rebrandable service for their clients but it went no further. Really glad someone has done it.]]></description>
