		<description><![CDATA[@PaulMWatson I like your line of thinking. The pixenate facebook app was basically just a repurposed theme I had lying around - the view essentially remained unchanged - I just plugged in a facebook-specific controller.

It would just be a matter of swapping in a different controller that used the OpenSocial API instead of Facebook&#039;s.]]></description>
