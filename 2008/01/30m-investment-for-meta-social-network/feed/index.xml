		<description><![CDATA[The whole thing gets curioser and curioser. Well, at least they got on TC USA! 

I want to dig more into the functionality of the site and what genuine benefits it provides. Many FB fans would claim that this type of filtering can already be done on FB if you are sensible about the level of sharing you do on things. 

I have a simple rule of thumb, if I don&#039;t want people to see stuff, I don&#039;t put it on the web, period. Family-only pics are about the only thing I don&#039;t make public and even then, URL obfuscation is sufficient.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice write up! Just a FYI, Silicon Republic is giving a slight wrong picture of Moli, their EMEA HQ is here, with most of the staff of Mainstream Holdings group based in Florida USA, including MOLI.com and its sister companies and have been live and open for business for 6+ months now. So calling it Irish is a bit of a strecth :)
