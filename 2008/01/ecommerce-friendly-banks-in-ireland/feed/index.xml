		<description><![CDATA[There is a way of doing this without the hassels. It requires meeting someone who has done it before. I have installed many of these payment systems with realex and Irish merchant accounts. Alot of the time it can depend on who you deal with in the bank and how strictly they are adhering to internal policy. If you were to adhere to the letter of the bank internal law entry to ecommerce would cost way more than it does at the moment. 

It depends on what you think your transaction rate and turnover is going to be on whether you choose worldpay, paypal, endevour or realex. 

The quickest we have completed a realex integration from merchant credit account to payments live online is 6 weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is definitely scope for someone to step in here and take the online processing / merchant account / setting up an online transaction site much easier..This isn&#039;t the first horror story I&#039;ve heard. Why paypal doesn&#039;t move towards a more transparent payment gateway type option is beyond me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You would think it gets easier when you want to set up a system to send money to the bank! Unfortunately not, we had similar issues with BOI. They refused to set up a merchant account because our company address was also my home address. When asked some explanations, I was told that this was company policy and that&#039;s it. So we had to change the company address and complete a 30 pages application with business plan and full 9 yards to get started. Oh and we also had to set up an account with the intermediary company, Realex in our case, to process the transaction. it took us a good 3 months to get things in order, a good thing we didn&#039;t have users queuing up to send us money. My piece of advice, use paypal!]]></description>
