		<description><![CDATA[Good ideas there.
I was recently talking to someone in North Tipperary county council. They ahve put the whole planning application system online. It&#039;s searchable, very user friendly and will soon have integrated mapping.
What i&#039;ve noticed is that these kind of initiatives within local and national government more often than not come from the bottom up...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was reading yesterday how an api was released in the UK for social problems.  For example, a burst pipe was noticed on a road in London, someone pinpoints the location, describes the issue in detail and then it gets sent to the relavant council authority.  It notes when the issue was posted, the reply from the council and any subsequent action undertaken by the governing authority.

I totally agree that the data made availabile by the government should be a priority.  Hiding all this info just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, as does the fee required by the FOI act.]]></description>
