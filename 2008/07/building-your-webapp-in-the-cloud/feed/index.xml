		<description><![CDATA[@John - you shouldn&#039;t have to have time to learn and play with cloud computing - it should be as easy (or easier) than standard development, just on a much better platform. 

We&#039;d be happy to host a session on-site in our Data Centre and aside from just talking about Cloud Computing, we can show you a real platform. Of course in return we&#039;d like to hear what web application developers REALLY want from their app hosting providers!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Conor,
  Would be very interested in attending such an event. Personally I would be interested in hearing a mix of biz and tech (with more tech than biz). I have never done any cloud development but armed with my app engine account I am desperately looking for some time to learn and play.
