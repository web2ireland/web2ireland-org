		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll put a post up (and an OCC Cork mailshot) and see what people think. I doubt it&#039;d take a full day. Maybe a morning? 

Since Seedcamp is vaguely in competition to Rubicon/Genesis, I dunno if that is a runner :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oriel seems the best option. 

I was looking at the rooms available there recently for hiring out for a day. I don&#039;t have the costs with me now, but I think its around 150 for a room for a day. I have a brochure and contact details at home to review.

Would it be best to put a post up, find out how many are interested then I can book a room there?

Or, should we just opt for the board room of the Rubicon or the Macroom E building in Macroom?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m up for it. Oriel might be better from a &quot;where the hell is it?&quot; point of view :-) 

Can&#039;t do Thursdays or OCC Friday&#039;s but open any other day. Wanna put the call out on Twitter/Jaiku? I can do a new post here if you like and pop something on Upcoming.org?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would people be interested in meeting for this? I could arrange a room in Oriel House in Ballincollig if thats a good central location.

Alternatively, everyone is welcome to my house where Ill feed people in return for picking their brains for helping me pitch for Seedcamp]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hung around at a lot of the SeedCamp week events in London last year as the drunken Irish fella. Looked great.

I&#039;m planning on entering D4H but would love to get the &#039;Irish Mafia&#039; (as we&#039;re known there!) together to work on a bunch of Irish entries together, bringing everyone from Ireland up a peg higher.

3 weeks to go!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ye know, that&#039;s a really good idea. If we could get some past SeedCorn winners to come in, I&#039;m sure they had to deal with similar questions. We could brainstorm an application form for anyone who is thinking about it.

Timing is a problem tho as the next Cork OCC is not due until 15th Aug because of Bank Holiday Weekend.

Maybe an out-of-cycle meet-up in a coffee shop with just those interested in helping and those interested in applying?

Or go crazy and use some vidconferencing too to pull in folks from OCC Dub, Limerick and Waterford?]]></description>
