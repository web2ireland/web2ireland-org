		<description><![CDATA[Ah....&quot;the event&quot; - I didn&#039;t realise that the list was referring to the conference you discussed in your earlier post. 

I&#039;m familiar with the area of Ubiquitous Computing, but hadn&#039;t heard the phrase &quot;ubiquitous social networks&quot; before. It&#039;s an interesting direction to take these types of technologies / applications in.

Thanks for clearing it up anyway!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave, 
One of the key themes of the event was the whole &quot;Ubiquitous Social Networks&quot; which means that everything will be social. The thought of having to go to a particular site to be social (like Facebook) will be archaic. The idea of OpenSocial - take your identity and friends with you - is just the beginning.]]></description>
