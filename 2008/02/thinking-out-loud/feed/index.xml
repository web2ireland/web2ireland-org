		<description><![CDATA[How about rather than allowing negative comments, do positive only?

i.e. anyone can put their known name to a designer (authentication of that name is the only interesting part).

		<description><![CDATA[A great idea - I don&#039;t think there are directories in there in Ireland, and if there are then obviously not enough people know about them!  I have been using Twitter lately, &quot;can someone recommend a freelancer who is an expert with Flex?&quot; but a directory would make it much easier for me.

I agree with Adam, keep it simple - just a list with profiles: name, website, skills, location contact info, status (&quot;looking for any freelance work&quot;, &quot;only interested in Flash&quot;, etc.).  I could bang this out in 30mins in Django.  What do you think Conor, freelancers.ie?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sent you a link to a system we have built that might be suitable for you.
A quick search brings up the following list. Looking at them i see not enough focus on back end specialities and some out of date. It would need a reporting system for dead links and businesses.

		<description><![CDATA[I think filtering is more appropriate to a commercial operation who can deal with all the conflict resolutions etc.

If there are existing directories, please post the URLs here because I&#039;m not aware of them. The other useful thing to post would be interest group mailing lists (Python Ireland etc). If I&#039;d known about Ruby Ireland in 2006........]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comhar.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Comhar&lt;/a&gt; in Cork offers an Elance style service for Irish companies that addresses a lot of this. 

I was more thinking a simple directory with no commentary etc. Would be up to each company seeking services to do their own due diligence and ensure that the service provider is ok. It would just be the starting point for most people who currently do things like googling &quot;web development ireland&quot; or mailing their mates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Having thought about it for a long while it does need some kind of non libellous feedback system. Perhaps a list of referrals potential users can personally ask about freelancer. This is essential for us.
Also for designers one or two image previews of their design work. Using the directory on Creative Ireland is a nightmare clicking through links and hoping 1. they actually have a site and 2. they have a portfolio.]]></description>
