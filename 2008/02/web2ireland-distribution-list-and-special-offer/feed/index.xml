		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s to allow the Web2Ireland Editors to send intermittent emails where a blog post may not be appropriate or immediate enough. e.g. &quot;We&#039;ve just found out that famous Tech Journalist XYZ is coming to Dublin tonight and wants to meet companies&quot;. A blogpost would miss at least 70% of the relevant people due to timing, which has been proven in the past with that exact situation.

Roomex recently made us a very kind offer which they sometimes do to groupings involved in particular areas. It&#039;s no different to designers offering discounted services to startups. Given the amount of travel most of us do, it didn&#039;t strike me as odd at all, but very welcome. 

If you don&#039;t want to be on the distie list but would like the discount, just let us know. Both are entirely opt-in and the sweetener quip is just a bit of lighthearted fun.]]></description>
