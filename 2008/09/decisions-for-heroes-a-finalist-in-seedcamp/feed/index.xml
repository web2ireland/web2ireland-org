		<description><![CDATA[Hearty congrats to D4H - I think its a great idea, and I also think its a cool idea. 

ClubW.tv also applied and got PFO&#039;d. What the hell, its another learning experience.

Has Ireland got the critical mass required to carry off one of these events. I have no doubt that it has. Ideas, technology, drive, capital - despite what many say, it is my experience that there is plenty of all about at the moment.

What we are missing is leadership. Should Enterprise Ireland organise this? A private person/group? A college? It doesn&#039;t matter - We still need one person to drive this, at first anyway.

Oh, just in case anyone is confused, I am not that person.]]></description>
