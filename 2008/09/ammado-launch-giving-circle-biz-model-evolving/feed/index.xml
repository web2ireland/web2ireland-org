		<description><![CDATA[I had an interview with Ammando back in 2007 - I found it to be a very unprofessional interview with a hint of snobbery on Ammando&#039;s part.

I must admit there where a cheque lying on the table when I was being interviewed (Ulster bank - a couple of grand nothing really.....was it a test!!!!....No, I think it was just bad management.)

I was glad I didnâ€™t get the job â€“ working out of a kitchen in a houseâ€¦..well it could have been a toiletâ€¦.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see the point in Ammado. I think charities around the world are and should be encouraged to publicise their causes visibly on the internet. Companies and corporations who want to help a charity should be able to find their preferred charity / charities without having to pay a single cent. All money should go directly to the charities and the staff who worked hard in the organisations. It is a waste of resources to pay Ammado to match-make.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Obviously Peter Conlon and Anna Kupka are not very charitable people at the end of the day when you see what they have done to their own staff at xsil (just before xmas). I personally will never donate a cent through ammado.com to fill the pockets of such unscrupulous people and I hope others will see these people for what they really are and take a similar stance! As stated above if you are going to give to charity, give to the charity not these people!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Unfortunately, ammado.com has some uncharitable people running it. Peter Conlon and Anna Kupka, the founders of Ammado, have refused to pay staff of their other company, Xsil, since September.
This was just before the Christmas, too, so a lot of people with mortgages and children were left high and dry. The staff were only officially let go in December.
Donâ€™t be taken in by these crooks. If you want to give to charity, just give to charity. Their web-site is nonsense anyway.

For more info, see:
http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/1206/1228515634652.html

There are also several other interesting web results, given the correct google key-words.

To any ammado staff: Mr Conlon and Ms Kupka WILL do the same to you.

Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would advise charities against jumping into bed with Anna, Peter or both as to be associated with theese people will not be good in the coming months.

Also if staff at ammado should read this I&#039;d advise you to form a union as the same thing could happen at ammado as happened at Xsil.

If Peter should read this I hope you had a wonderful Christmas......I DID NOT!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the way Anna say&#039;s. Quote:we encourage employers to boost employee motivation.

Just over 4 weeks after she made this statement. Anna and her 2 co-directors at Xsil ltd Peter Conlon &amp; Patrick Rainsfeld refused to pay wages to their employees in Xsil for the month of October.

Recently Ammado moved to new premises. While their Staff in Xsil are forgot about. They made sure that their Xsil employees suffered the worst Christmas ever. Not only do they still refuse to pay their Xsil employees the wages owed for October.  1 week before Christmas all Xsil staff were made redundant.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Fergus, thanks for this. Just to clarify: for individuals ammado charges 5% per donation. These 5% stay in the ammado foundation and help us to cover the cost which are very substantial as we have build a global micro-payment platform, accepting 33 currencies and nearly every payment method around the world (further payment methods are being added). 

The 10% you have mentioned are an administration fee for an employer solution: we encourage employers to boost employee motivation by allocating a certain amount - let&#039;s say â‚¬10 per employee - to all their employees and allow them to allocate the amount to whatever nonprofits they wish. The employee could therefore give 1 Euro of these 10 to their old school in Belarus, 2.50 Euro to a charity in their hometown, 2 Euro for Amnesty in Ireland etc. It can be sliced down to as little as 4cent. That&#039;s why we call it micro-philanthropy. Everyone can build their own giving portfolio and if you wish to, people can show whom they are spporting by displaying their ammado Giving Circle (we also have a bebo applicaton for the circle). Cheers, Anna]]></description>
