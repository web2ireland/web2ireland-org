<div class="entry"><p>David McWilliams did <a href="http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/2008/12/21/ireland-inc-gets-innovative">an uncharacteristically bad</a> fan-boy analysis on his blog recently of the latest attempt by the government to bootstrap home-grown high potential businesses. His post lacks any real substance and drowns in Minister-style knowledge economy buzzword bingo.</p>

<p>It kicked off a very long comment thread, most of which is unreadable, but which contains some real gems. The best of the lot is by Johnny Dunne who has a deep knowledge of the investment environment in Ireland.</p>
<p>Johnny does a brilliant analysis of how wrong-headed the â‚¬500m approach is in the short term, whilst accepting that long term it could provide benefit. It&#8217;s just a pity that those who are making these fundamental decisions are taking their advice from the foxes minding the hen-house who have already killed all the chickens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quoting it here with Johnny&#8217;s permission:</p>
<blockquote><p>The â‚¬500 â€œInnovation Fundâ€ is a great â€˜medium to long termâ€™ idea to help fund the development of businesses based in Ireland selling valuable good and services to international customers.</p>
<p>Our problems are a lot more urgent &#8211; we face a serious fall off in economic activity again in 2009. For example, Dell alone pulling out of Ireland with â‚¬10 bn+ / 10% of GDP gone in one go !</p>
<p>David, if the government can invest NPRF of â‚¬1.5 billion in â€˜cashâ€™ within â€˜one monthâ€™ in a bank with â€˜poorâ€™ assets and without a CEO and therefore you would have to assume NO business plan. I have never heard of a VC or a bank investing in a company without a Chairman, CEO and agreed plan !</p>
<p>Why not focus the â€˜special finance unitâ€™ in Anglo (and AIB,BOI) to invest say â‚¬500 million in growth companies without taking security as the government is not doing so! This unit which exist already invest in many â€˜largerâ€™ growth oriented companies some of them would be Enterprise Ireland clients. For example, the main criteria used for lending in Anglo are people, cashflows and asset quality. The government have guaranteed the liabilities and injected cash so the banks should lend to â€˜goodâ€™ people with a â€˜credibleâ€™ and (dare I say it) innovative business plans without recourse to personal guarantees and propert / assets backed security.</p>
<p>There needs to be urgent action with a â€˜fundâ€™ launched in January with say â‚¬500 million to invest in 2009 &#8211; why not? Anglo increased lending by â‚¬9 billion in 2008! A medium term plan to invest â‚¬500 million over many years is not enough. This money may not â€˜startâ€™ investing for at least another 12 to 18 months, even then if it is in the hands of US VCs it may provide little employment in Ireland &#8211; assume investee companies will need qualifying Irish operations ? If the local VCs like Delta, Atlantic bridge and NCB canâ€™t find opportunities with their strict â€˜VCâ€™ criteria, then the international VCs will find it harder unless we open the â€˜flood gatesâ€™ to fund earlier stage / developing companies.</p>
<p>There is a requirement (and suggestion) for many small funds say of â‚¬10 million each investing less than â‚¬1 million in a number of firms in order to open the â€˜pipeâ€™ of funded start-ups which can access further development capital at a later stage. Enterprise Irelandâ€™s policy with the latest round of â‚¬175 million of VC funds which 2 years after itâ€™s announcement has only allocated to 5 of the possible 8 funds. There is a â€˜believeâ€™ within Enterprise Ireland that small funds donâ€™t work as they donâ€™t have sufficient fund to follow their money. There has been calls for proposals from VCs, one in 2006 and another this year for the same money as the selected VCs couldnâ€™t seem to raise matching funds ? While over 20 funds applied on each occasion, only 8 were selected as 5 of these could only raise sufficient funds of at least â‚¬30 million inclusing state money. EI says this initial funding has leveraged â‚¬500 million for investment but already some of the more active funds like Delta and Atlantic Bridge have made multiple investments in non Irish companies. The reason ? based on their â€˜investmentâ€™ criteria not sufficient opportunities in Ireland ?</p>
<p>So why are the Government allocating Irish â€˜pensionâ€™ funds to US VC funds on a 50:50 basis now, when it could have done this many years ago when it was suggested before. Instead the â€˜mandarinsâ€™ in the NPRF and â€˜beancountersâ€™ in the Dept of Finance felt it was better to invest in international equities which we know where theyâ€™ve gone &#8211; south! US â€˜Tier 1? VC funds are well able to raise their own funds without state support 9this should apply where the market wonâ€™t go &#8211; remember there was 20 unsuccessful applicatns locally for the previous EI VC funding rounds). Why not just use the â€˜preferentialâ€™ tax to ensure they invest through and in Ireland not invest directly when they can access other sources of finance and need to be free to invest on an international basis. Local fund and banks can invest !</p>
<p>There is â‚¬400 billion of loans outstanding but AIB have contributed â‚¬15 with Enterprise Ireland to a â‚¬30 million seed fund and BOI have invested about â‚¬20 million in a â‚¬70 million fund which EI would have invested a similar amount. Recently Ulster invested a smaller amount with EI in the NCB fund. We are investing over â‚¬ 5 billion within 3 months in 3 banks with â€˜no securityâ€™ and a relatively small return up to 10% (VCs look for 30% and use preference shares all the time but ensure they can convert to control the business if management donâ€™t execute on the business plan). Why not pass the same terms through to ANY business certified by Enterprise Ireland or the IDA with a â€˜qualifyingâ€™ export oriented operation with the potential to generate more jobs and exports in the short term generating tax revenuesâ€¦.</p>
<p>The â€˜mind changeâ€™ needs to be within the Irish financial services sector to fund this â€˜Smart Economyâ€™ of the future.</p>
<p>Or should we just let â€œScience Foundation Ireland spend â‚¬7 billion on education and training in the years aheadâ€ with no medium term opportunity of generating sales !</p>
<p>There must be independent advisers with experience of investing or raising VC and banking funds better placed to advise the Minister rather than â€˜City folkâ€™ from Merrill Lynch generating massive fees to â€˜give awayâ€™ tax payers and pension funds money in return for no equity in the 2 major banks AIB and BOI which are obviously undervalued, as they donâ€™t seem to understand where the irish economy is and what it needs to survive over the next decade ???</p></blockquote>

<div class="entry"><p>The fab designer of Web2Ireland, <a href="http://hiimjames.com/">James Gallagher</a>, just contacted me about the re-launch of <a href="http://livewebstars.tv/">LiveWebStars</a> and their partnering with one of my fave web-sites, <a href="http://www.downloadmusic.ie/">DownloadMusic.ie</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-948" title="livewebstars" src="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/livewebstars.jpg" alt="livewebstars" width="562" height="314" /></p>
<p>Livewebstars.tv promotes new music by enabling up-and-coming artists to perform and interact using live on-line streaming &#8211; broadcasting their lives, practice sessions, gigs etc to an audience right around the globe.</p>
<p>By working together with DownloadMusic, they enable consumers to buy mp3s with their mobile phone and also watch, hear and chat to the band in real time.</p>
<p>This is the sort of smart partnering that makes complete sense. It benefits everyone involved and will be of huge benefit to Indie Bands trying to get noticed and differentiate themselves.</p>

<div class="author">
<img src="/wp-content/themes/default/w2i/authors/1.jpg" width="30" height="30" alt="admin" title="admin" />
<small>19th of <a href="/2008/12/">December 2008</a> by admin</small>
</div>

<div class="entry"><p>Speaking at a press conference in Dublin Castle, Taoiseach Brian Cowen, announced a range of measures to boost the economy &#8211; through a new renewal programme &#8211; around &#8220;Building Irelandâ€™s Smart Economy -<br />
A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal&#8221; &#8211; see <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/index.asp?locID=584&#038;docID=4146">press release</a> and <a href="http://193.178.1.117/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Building%20Ireland%E2%80%99s%20Smart%20Economy.pdf">pdf document</a> on report.</p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>Some interesting nuggets from the report</p>
<p>Up to â‚¬500 million will be generated to create a venture fund, known as â€˜Innovation Fund â€“ Irelandâ€™, to support early stage R&#038;D-intensive SMEs.  The capital will be divided into five venture funds of between â‚¬75-150 million; [see <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2008/12/17/should-government-get-involved-with-vcs/">previous post on VC funding in Ireland</a>]</p>
<p>More favourable tax treatment of the carried interest of venture capital is being introduced at a rate of 15% for partnerships and 12.5% for companies to encourage the availability of so-called â€˜smart capitalâ€™ for investing in start-up innovative companies who will be the employers of the future; </p>
<p>Entrepreneurship, business start-ups and employment creation will be driven by a number of highly-favourable taxation measures including exemption from corporation tax arising in the first three years of operation for business start-ups, a tax abatement scheme for restricted shares, and a refund in the case of forfeited shares, to<br />
assist companies, including start-up companies, in retaining key employees; </p>
<p>Venture capital investment is still relatively under-developed in Ireland. When defined as formal investment outside public capital markets, which represents total start-up, expansion and buyout investments, Ireland ranks 12th in the EU-15 in this regard; </p>
<p>Ireland ranks 4th across the OECD and 2nd in Europe for the proportion of early stage entrepreneurs with 8.2% of adults in Ireland engaged in entrepreneurial activity in 2007 up from 7.4% in 2006; </p>
<p>High concentration of leading high-tech multinationals many of which have facilitated a huge technological transfer from Silicon Valley to Ireland; </p>
<p>Ireland is ranked as 7th out of 182 countries as a place to do business; the 5th easiest place to establish a business; and the 3rd cheapest location for starting a business. Enterprise Ireland has a strong system to support high-potential start-up enterprises and a growing international presence; </p>
<p>â€˜Smart capitalâ€™ can be defined as (a) adequate levels of early stage funds for SMEs; (b) providing value-added networks to key decision-makers; and (c) experienced investment managers. European venture funds have performed relatively poorly in comparison to US funds and so it remains difficult to attract the best (Tier 1) VCs from the US. Nevertheless, it is these types of VCs that provide the best possible networks and management experience that can develop Irish-based companies.  </p>
<p>Just as Ireland fashioned itself to become the destination of choice for multinational enterprises, the vision is to establish Ireland as The Innovation Island through: Continued substantial investment in science and technology infrastructure and research; A substantial investment in early stage venture capital to commercialise and capitalise on this investment, similar to the Israeli Yozma Fund; The attraction of experienced and top-tier venture partners (including those described as Tier 1 VCs) operating independently to manage to raise capital and focus on deal-flow creation; </p>
<p>To attract high-quality mobile entrepreneurs to set up businesses in Ireland and to assist start-up companies to retain employees, we are providing for a tax abatement scheme for restricted shares; </p>

<div class="entry"><p>I was thrilled to hear from Campbell Scott that <a href="http://www.IGOpeople.com/">IGOpeople</a> is in public beta starting today. They&#8217;ve been in stealth mode for a long time and we&#8217;ve all been looking forward to seeing it in action.</p>

Campbell describes it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>a Network for the Real World that brings people together to Find, Connect and Converse, with their friends and with the businesses and organisations they deal with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounding like a very useful mix of Social Networking, discussion boards, <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/">GetSatisfaction</a> and <a href="http://uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, it looks like a great way for companies to see what people have to say about them.</p>

<p>I had a pleasure of attending LeWeb last week &#8211; and here are the top 10 takeaways</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Irish in attendance</strong><br />
Very low Irish presence &#8211; <a href="http://www.maxroam.com/">Pat Phelan from Maxroam</a>, Conor O&#8217;Neill  from Loudervoice [who also <a href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2008/12/11/lovin-le-web/">covered event</a> for <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/le_web_2008.php">ReadwriteWeb</a>]<br />
- <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/5/40b/aa8">Brian Bastible</a> and colleagues from <a href="http://www.idaireland.com/">IDA</a></p>
<p><strong>Connecting with People</strong><br />
Lots of great folks attending from the US, UK, Germany, France and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Old School is best school</strong><br />
Got to meet and chat with <a href="http://www.accmanpro.com/2008/12/11/leweb-le-wrap/">Dennis</a>, <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jobsworth">JP</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Glimpse of future</strong><br />
<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&#038;story=176">Dave Morin</a> &#8211; <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/connect.php">facebook connect</a>, <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/962491">Marissa Mayer &#8211; Google</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/susanwu">Susan Wu</a> &#8211; <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/930724">Virtual Goods</a></p>
<p><strong>Startups &#8211; no Irish&#8230; come on !!</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/startup.html">Startup Competition </a> &#8211; some interesting startups &#8211; and very <a href="http://www.lewebparis.com/2008/12/leweb08-startup-winners.html">worthy  winner</a> &#8211; some Web2Ireland companies would have done well at this event&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Failure &#8211; true stories</strong><br />
<a href="http://lundxy.com/">Morten Lund</a> was <a href="http://patphelan.net/morten-lund-the-best-of-le-web/">one highlight of the event &#8211; off the cuff</a> &#8211; very honest in his story.</p>
<p><strong>Funding is hard in Europe</strong><br />
Lots of VCs in attendance [none from Ireland] &#8211; and the VC panel was interesting &#8211; <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/933026">see video</a>. Key themes &#8211; build products that VCs will use [Fred Wilson, Martin Varsasky, Jeff Clavier] &#8211; and they don&#8217;t really believe <a href="http://ouriel.typepad.com/myblog/2008/12/can-governments.html">Govt intervention @ funding</a> is key [more on that later] &#8211; and <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2008/11/boxee.html">NO doesnt mean NO</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Go Big or Go Home</strong><br />
Lots of usual talk @ <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/13/joie-de-vivre-the-europeans-are-out-to-lunch/">valley versus Europe</a> and can we build a big European web company. </p>
<p><strong>Annual LeWeb bitch fight</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/12/should-michael.html">Great fun</a> from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/13/joie-de-vivre-the-europeans-are-out-to-lunch/">the sideline</a></p>
<p><strong>Next Year</strong><br />
Rumour has it that the <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20070726/kara-and-walt-visit-the-irish-countryside-and-pretend-were-lords-of-the-manor/">International D Conference</a> will happen in Dublin next year</p>
<p>And no doubt LeWeb 09 will be another enjoyable event.</p>

<div class="entry"><p>Ciaran Rooney, CTO of <a href="http://skimbit.com/">Skimbit</a>, has just announced the launch of <a href="http://skimlinks.com/">Skimlinks</a> which makes being an Affiliate far easier than heretofore.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-920" title="skimlinks-logo" src="http://www.web2ireland.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/skimlinks-logo-300x79.png" alt="skimlinks-logo" width="300" height="79" /></p>
<p>The idea is that Publishers sign up for Skimlinks, and once approved, have access to thousands of merchants across 11 affiliate networks internationally. They just have to add one line of code to their site and then the entire site, including existing content, is enabled.</p>
<p>The Publishers continue to create content and add links to merchants&#8217; products and services as normal. When a user clicks on these links, Skimlinks turns it into its affiliate link equivalent on-the-fly. If the user then buys something from the merchantâ€™s site, the publisher earns a commission.</p>
<p>Skimlinks also offers the publisher a reporting interface that consolidates all their affiliate activity and earnings across all networks, and gives them visibility into to the traffic they are sending to each merchant. The service is currently free to use, and Skimlinks only takes a small cut of the commissions earned by the publisher.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fantastic to see something new in the Affiliate space and even better to see a a solid business model from day 1 with customers like Shiny Media at launch.</p>
