		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if some kind of speed networking session could be tied into Barcamp Cork? Personally speaking I&#039;m not the most outward-going person in the world and find myself at Barcamps gravitating towards people I recognize/know. And I know I&#039;m not the only one - it seems to be a fairly common geek trait!. So perhaps one session dedicated to speed networking for those who&#039;d like to make new contacts (like me) in a less awkward manner. Just do it like speed-dating - eg. divide the attendees into two even groups, allow 2 or 3 minutes for each pair to chat, ring the bell, everyone moves to the next person in line, etc,.

[Yes, I have been speed-dating and it works great :)]]]></description>
