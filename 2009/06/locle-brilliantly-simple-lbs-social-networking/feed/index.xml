		<description><![CDATA[Its amazing how technology shortens phone conversations. Caller ID means we no longer have to start phone conversations with &quot;Hi it&#039;s Alan, is that Fergus?&quot;.

And now Locle means the mobile phone age conversation opener &quot;what are you up to?&quot; will be made redundant.

Possible replaced with enquiries such as &quot;What are you doing by the canal this late at night?&quot;

What next, automated goodbye audio signatures?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Should really be call Locale &quot;Urban&quot; as Cell ID is of no real use outside major urban areas where the absence of a second or third Mobile Phone mast reduces the resolution to several hundred meters.

In general, Cell ID is not suited to actively finding people, places or things. Locale really needs a GPS enabled phone to make it useful and allow it take full benefit from the new PON Code system for Ireland.]]></description>
