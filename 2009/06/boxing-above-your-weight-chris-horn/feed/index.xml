		<description><![CDATA[&quot;A paradox resulting from the small and open Irish economy is that Irish technology driven start-ups have to think globally first, not later;&quot;

This is a great point. Something we realised within a month of starting up in Oct &#039;08 was that Ireland was too small for our offering. Naturally, we looked to London first, and got up and running there in March. 

I would also wholeheartedly agree on the point about partners. It&#039;s not impossible to do a startup on your own, but it&#039;s got to be tough. Having two other partners to drive the company with me and a fourth in the wings has been a great help. Knowing that you&#039;re working towards shared goals with guys who you trust and have your back is, I feel, a key component to making a startup a success.]]></description>
