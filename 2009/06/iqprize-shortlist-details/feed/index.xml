		<description><![CDATA[Dear Morgan,

Just a thought, as I&#039;d be very interested in finding out how my idea ranks ... how about interested people pre-booking a consultation so you&#039;ll know the numbers and the ideas in advance, then we all get together?

I can appreciate that all involved have demands on their time, if it could be slotted in at some stage I&#039;d be most grateful.

Many thanks,

Anthony.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alan,

Given the volume of entries, and the general mad busyness of the judges, it will be really difficult for us to give individual feedback to everyone. 

That said, I&#039;m really happy to facilitate some kind of morning session, if we can manage it, where we can feed back some more general info to entrants who are interested.

Hope this helps,

Morgan]]></description>
