		<description><![CDATA[Dylan knows what he&#039;s talking about.

I&#039;m 16 and I&#039;m into web startups, yet there&#039;s no real Irish-based Venture Capitalist available in this country.

I&#039;m expecting I will going to have to go to companies like Y Combinator who invest in foreign companies, and move to America as I get funding (although personally I wouldn&#039;t mind this at all as I want to live there permanently, but for a large portion of Irish startups, this is not the case).

I really like the idea of a few hundred grants per year of $50,000 each.

Well since they haven&#039;t listened in the last decade, I would imagine there&#039;s even less chance of them doing anything amidst a recession.

Hopefully the new government will be more geared towards what will actually make money (i.e. technology) and save the country they&#039;re attempting to run.]]></description>
