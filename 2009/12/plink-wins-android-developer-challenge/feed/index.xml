		<description><![CDATA[Info about the artist, history of the painting etc. includes more than the artist&#039;s name, of course.

This is useful, and at any rate a step forward. The same functionality for sculptures and alike would be the next big step: automatic 3D object recognition via two still images via stereoscopy. The next natural step is a database search robot that does object recognition through a single still image. Video clip analysis seems out of reach a few more 18 monthses.

Check out Google Goggles! (if you have an Android phone.)]]></description>
