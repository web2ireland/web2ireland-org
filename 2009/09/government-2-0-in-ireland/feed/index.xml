		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a great initiative. If you are setting up a &quot;working group&quot; I would love to get involved.

There is a site which searches all various public transport services in Dublin that you might like to link to http://hittheroad.ie/ (I have nothing to do with the creators of the site).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good starting point might be the LGCSB. Happy to see they have a strong focus on OSS now, albeit 10 years later than they should. If they become the torch-bearers for Gov APIs, the rest should follow. Do they take part in these events?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One big problem with advocating govt APIs is trying to work out how to get developers inside county councils involved in this admirable cause. In fiscally trying times, several councils I know have little or no developer assets. Sometimes that&#039;s because developers on the payrolls are seconded to other jobs, covering maternity breaks or pressing manpower problems in other parts of the county council. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if Conor, Niall or Joe would be interested in attending a meet-up of county council developers, to explain this important idea. Those half-day events happen several times a year in different parts of Ireland.]]></description>
