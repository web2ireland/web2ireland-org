		<description><![CDATA[I was encouraged to hear about  Halo Business Angel Network National Directorate which is being jointly funded between Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade - its mission, as umbrella to regional Halo networks,  is to encourage angel investment for pre-screened investment opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is being headed by Diane Roberts who many of you might know for her work in EI, and is officially launching in Dublin 16th September. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regretably the website is not functional, so further info from &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@hban.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;info@hban.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best&lt;br&gt;Barry&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://IrishDev.com&quot;/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://IrishDev.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;News, Events and Jobs for the Irish Software Community]]></description>
