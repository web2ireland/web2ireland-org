		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll put my hand up and say I fell for this when I saw it posted on twitter by @conoro. I didn&#039;t read the whole post before retweeting (my fail!), because - and forgive my idealism here - I said to myself: &quot;What a great message to send to the global web tech community, this is exactly the type of positive action needed right now, fair play, how can we help?&quot;.

For this reason, I don&#039;t really get why the guys behind Web2Ireland (for whom I&#039;ve lots of respect) would make a joke over something like this. 

Maybe I shouldn&#039;t take this so seriously, on the 1st of April of all days? Yeah maybe. 

Or maybe I think there is amazing opportunity in an idea such as this (perhaps with a smaller funding amount), and it&#039;d be nice to see people taking that seriously.

OK, time to get off the soap box.]]></description>
